The daily passenger capacity can reach 1 million passengers. During the peak period, the one-way passenger flow per hour is as high as 26,900, which is second only to Bogota's rapid transit system. There is one bus every 10 seconds, and each bus travels 350 hours in one direction. The platform, including the bridge, is the longest state bus rapid transit system platform in the world, with a length of 260 meters. At present, taxis and buses in Guangzhou City mainly use liquefied petroleum gas as fuel, and some buses use oil-electricity, gas-electric hybrid technology. A bus for LNG fuel began to be launched at the end of 2012. In June 2014, a LNG plug-in hybrid bus was introduced to replace the LPG bus. On January 16, 2007, the Guangzhou Municipal Government completely banned the driving of motorcycles in urban areas. Motor vehicles that violate the ban will be confiscated. The Guangzhou Municipal Transportation Bureau claimed that the implementation of the ban caused traffic congestion and car accidents to be greatly reduced. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport is located at the junction of Baiyun District and Huadu District. It was officially put into operation on August 5, 2004. It is the second busiest airport in China. The airport replaced the old airport that was originally located in the city centre and could not meet the growing demand for aviation. At present, the airport has three airstrips, making it the third civil aviation airport with three runways in China. It is 8 years earlier than the expected completion of the third runway of the adjacent Hong Kong International Airport in 2023."

There have been records of rice planting two thousand years ago. Guangzhou in the Song Dynasty was one of the largest rice markets in China, and vegetables, fruits, sugar cane and flowers were also well-known. Since it has been a national port for a long time, Guangzhou has introduced a variety of excellent crop varieties. In the first half of the twentieth century, Guangzhou’s agricultural growth slowed down due to the invasion of foreign agricultural products and the impact of war. In the mid-fifties of the 1950s, agricultural production increased sharply, but the late \"Great Leap Forward\" and the subsequent Cultural Revolution severely hit agricultural production. After the reform and opening up, with the development of Guangzhou as a big city, the suburban agricultural pattern serving the city has gradually formed. The government's policy is to serve the city, enrich the farmers and the people, and encourage export earnings. The specific measures are to reduce the proportion of grain production, increase the proportion of agricultural and sideline products such as fruits and vegetables, and strive to develop forestry, animal husbandry and fishery. The agricultural output value of Guangzhou has increased substantially, but with the rapid growth of the second and third industries, the proportion of agriculture in agriculture has gradually declined. In 1978, the total agricultural production value of Guangzhou accounted for 11.67% of the regional GDP, and in 1990 it fell to 8.05%. In 2015, the total agricultural output value of Guangzhou was 41.3 billion yuan, accounting for 2.28% of the regional GDP. The urban development and industrialization process also caused a large loss of rural labor and the rapid decline of agricultural land. In the five years of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the total area of the Tianshan Mountain Pond registered in Guangzhou was 106.623 million mu. In 1990, the area of cultivated land was 2.47 million mu, and in 2006 it was reduced to 1.583 million mu. At present, the places where agricultural products are grown in Guangzhou are mainly in Baiyun, Huadu, Panyu, Nansha, Conghua and Zengcheng. In 1990, the agricultural population was 2.5287 million, and in 2008 it was 792,200. The more famous agricultural specialties in Guangzhou include Wutang Wuxiu and various tropical fruits such as Litchi, banana, papaya and pineapple."

The shipbuilding industry, metallurgy and hardware industry, textile industry, food processing, Chinese medicine industry, ceramics industry and art workers all enjoyed the whole country. The cotton produced in Guangzhou in the early Qing Dynasty is famous for its light and warm, and the number is \"Guanghua\"; the \"Guangzhi Line Yarn\" is also boosted by the accumulation of wealth in the 13th line in Guangzhou. Because the cotton cloth is cheaper than the British cloth, there are many exports. Driven by huge interests, cotton processing has rapidly developed, and Xiguan farmland has been extensively developed, building factory streets, and Jinhua, Jinglun, and Maze are convenient for this period. The formation of the Guangzhou textile industry has driven the prosperity of printing and dyeing, machine tools, satin, garments, hats, footwear and wool. The suburbs of Xiaxiguanyong have also been developed into high-end residential areas. Many of the owners are foreign banks that have benefited from the textile industry. At that time, Xiguan had the so-called \"eight bridges\". In the 1870s, the Qing court launched the Westernization Movement, and Guangzhou's modern industry began to take off. The government-run enterprises have the Guangzhou Machine Bureau to manufacture foreign guns and ammunition, and the Guangdong Money Bureau is the first enterprise in China to make coins by machine. Private enterprises include Changlong Silk Factory, Taian Pharmacy, and Huaxing Weaving Corporation. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, a large number of light industrial factories were concentrated near Guangzhou. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the overseas Chinese's \"industry to save the country\" trend led to the rapid development of Guangzhou's light industry and the sharp growth of foreign trade, making Guangzhou a relatively developed city in China at the time, and attracting many foreigners to start businesses here. From 1929 to 1936, Chen Jizhen took advantage of the relatively stable political and economic environment and the world economic recession in the south to establish a relatively complete industrial system, which greatly promoted the Guangdong economy. During the Anti-Japanese War, Guangzhou was occupied by the Japanese army and the industry was completely destroyed. During the civil war, prices soared, and most of the factories were shut down or partially stopped, and the unemployed were public."

After the opening of Shanghai, with the gradual opening of the country, Guangzhou gradually lost its position as a foreign trade center, but it is still the most important commercial city in the country. After the reform and opening up, the Guangzhou department store industry flourished. In the 1980s, the Friendship Store specialized in selling electrical appliances and other imported goods for Hong Kong, Macao and foreign guests. The West Lake Road lighting night market is a popular destination for civilians.

After the Qing army occupied the Central Plains, the Nanming Shaowu Emperor Zhu Xi was built in Guangzhou, and soon Nanming was destroyed. Guangzhou of the Qing Dynasty became the provincial capital of Guangdong, Guangzhou Fucheng and Panyu and Nanhai County. Governors of Guangdong and Guangxi, Tuen Mun, Guangdong Governor, Tuen Mun, Guangdong Chief Secretary, and Guangdong Inspection Department are all within the boundaries of Nanhai County, Guangzhou. In 1858, the British and French coalition forces captured Guangzhou, the Guangdong governor surrendered, the Foreigners Committee was established, and the Guangdong government became the government."

In 1989, the citizens of Guangzhou launched a campaign to support the Tiananmen Democracy Movement. Millions of people gathered at Haizhu Square to gather around the Guangzhou Liberation Monument. In the early days, the Guangzhou media supported the name of the \"patriotic movement.\" After the bloodshed, the people rioted, the provincial and municipal government agencies were attacked, and all the Guangzhou media were immediately banned, which also interfered with and blocked the Hong Kong TV station. The provincial government dispatched military and police to suppress the marching masses, and a large number of participants sneaked into Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas. All enterprises and institutions also sent personnel to review whether employees of various departments have organized or participated in the assembly. In the national anti-American activities in 1999, hundreds of thousands of people and students marched in the city to protest against NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. At the same time, the US consulate in Guangzhou was also damaged by some radical demonstrators. The Guangzhou media has followed suit throughout the process, but there is no mention of the damage to the US consulate in Guangzhou. In 2005, there were hundreds of thousands of national anti-Japanese demonstrations.

It was the name of Guangzhou when it was first built, and it has been used in the Republic of China. In 226 and 246 AD, Wu Guo divided the Jiaozhou into two parts: \"Guanzhou\" and \"Guangzhou\". The south of Hepu was still called \"Guanzhou\", and the north of Hepu was called the \"Guangzhou\" of the Zhizhi Department of the State. \"Guangzhou\" includes Nanhai, Cangwu, Yulin and Hepu four counties. This was the beginning of the division of the two countries, and it was also the beginning of the name of \"Guangzhou\", but Guangzhou at that time only referred to a jurisdiction, which is equivalent to the current Guangdong Province. Since the Tang Dynasty, Guangzhou Prefecture has been established as the origin of Guangfu. It was officially established in 1921, and Panyu City was named Guangzhou for the first time. Guangzhou is also known as \"Five Sheep City\", \"Yangcheng\" and \"Suicheng\", referred to as \"Sui\". These aliases come from the legend of Wuyang: there were five immortals who wore five-color clothes and rode five-color sheep. They went to Guangzhou City with a grain of \"one stem and six leaves\". After handing the grain to the city, they flew away. And Wuyang is turned into stone. Therefore, Guangzhou is also known as \"Five Yangcheng\" and \"Suicheng\". Due to its location in the subtropical zone, the climate is warm and suitable for flower planting. In addition, Guangzhou people love to plant flowers, buy flowers and give flowers. The flower market is prosperous every year. Guangzhou also enjoys the reputation of Huacheng. Since the Tang Dynasty, Guangzhou was the capital city of Guangzhou Prefecture. After the Qing Dynasty, it was the provincial capital of Guangdong Province. Therefore, the provincial capital has become a general term for Cantonese people in Guangzhou. In ancient times, Guangzhou also had the titles of Nanwu City, Chuting, Panyu and Nanhai."

After the news of the media blockade in the Mainland, Guangzhou also blocked news footage related to Hong Kong TV. On August 1st, the Cantonese-speaking gathering in Guangzhou Central Park was strongly obstructed by the authorities. The people were forced to transfer routes. When they arrived at the southern section of Beijing Road, they were surrounded by a large number of police officers. The participants were taken to the bus and taken away at Dongshan Stadium. It was released after being questioned and convicted. The mainland petition system allows the public to express their appeals to higher-level government departments. The Guangdong provincial government often has petitioners from different parts of the province coming to the main entrance of Dongfeng Road to get help from the provincial government. At the time of the rally, the authorities will transfer a large number of police forces to actively deal with them. During the confrontation period, the traffic will usually be slow, but the local official media has never reported relevant reports. At the beginning of 2014, the more important petitioners were the poultry traders in the province who suffered losses during the avian flu period due to forced closure of the market, as well as the young people in Sui Maoming who opposed the petrochemical project in the Maoming black box."

During the period of “Creating Health”, the health situation in Guangzhou City has been significantly improved, such as cleaning up urban sanitation corners, urban villages, sewage treatment and food safety management. Some officials said that \"creation of health\" has only a starting point and no end. \"Creation\" is a \"people's heart project.\" There are also media questions and criticisms about the huge amount of public money spent on these projects, formalism and disturbances. The number of public funds spent on the two projects over the years has been billions, making it difficult to calculate. On the occasion of the Guangzhou Asian Games, the Guangzhou Municipal Government carried out a large number of urban construction projects before 2010, including: renovation of multiple roads and sidewalks, re-laying of floor tiles and flower bases; and gray-and-white paint for many new and old overpasses; Renovation of most street-facing arcades and historic buildings; red roofs for the rooftops of the street-facing buildings, renovation of the exterior walls and installation of air-conditioning compressor covers and lighting. However, some people have questioned the waste of the ruined roads during the Asian Games, and the destruction of the original history and artistic sense when renovating the street buildings and historical buildings. Many thieves were involved in the uniform renovation of thousands of buildings in the street. Through the scaffolding, thefts of hundreds of households were entered; shortly after the completion of the project, incidents involving the use of inferior materials were revealed, which was also criticized by many citizens. As one of the central cities in China, Guangzhou's medical insurance and convenience services have covered the whole city. Most municipal parks and all public toilets are also free."

Guangzhou is one of the cities with a high population density in the country. The majority of the population is concentrated in the old city. The average resident population density in the four central districts reaches 18,113 people per square kilometer. The Yuexiu District with the highest population density reached 34,009 people per square kilometer, which is more than 100 times that of the Conghua City with the lowest population density. The annual birth rate in Guangzhou has been below 9.6 per 1,000 since 2001, and the natural growth rate is below 3.4 per 1,000. The life expectancy of the citizens is higher than the national average. The life expectancy of men is 75.25 years and the life expectancy of women is 80.94 years. At the same time, the problem of population aging is also becoming increasingly prominent. By the end of 2008, the number of elderly people over the age of 60 reached 1,103,500, accounting for 13.4% of the city's total population. Among them, the old city has the highest proportion of the elderly population, which has exceeded 18%, and it is predicted that the elderly population will exceed 2 million in 2030. The sixth national census in 2010 showed that there were more males than females in Guangzhou. At the end of 2007, the male-female ratio was 109.46, which is 109.46 males per 100 females. There are 573,694 more men than women. Among them, the gender imbalance in the age group of 0 to 14 years old is serious, reaching 115.62, indicating that the gap in gender ratio in Guangzhou will expand in the future. The population of Guangzhou is mainly Han, accounting for 98.3% of the resident population, and a small number of domestic ethnic population is 219,900. It belongs to 55 ethnic minorities. Among them, there are 10 ethnic groups including Zhuang, Tujia, Miao, Yao, Hui, Man, Yi, Mongolia, Buyi and Korean. Guangzhou's rapid economic development and high employment opportunities have attracted a large number of migrant workers. In 2008, migrant workers reached 40% of the city's population.

However, the relationship between \"locals\" and \"foreigners\" is difficult to coordinate, and it also causes a series of social problems. Due to the limited capacity and employment capacity of Guangzhou, Guangzhou is unable to accommodate migrant workers from all over the country. Its security environment has been severely tested. The \"two robs and one thief\" incident often occurs, especially in urban villages. The Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences survey showed that 80% of the prisoners were \"outsiders\", and the Cantonese culture as the carrier of the Guangfu culture itself was excluded from foreigners and foreign dialects, thus increasing the xenophobia of Guangzhou residents. In recent years, due to the government's vigorous ban, Guangzhou's public security management has achieved remarkable results. In 2014, the Guangdong Provincial Government issued a document explicitly requiring the control of the population size of Guangzhou and Shenzhen megacities. In 2008, migrant workers accounted for 40% of Guangzhou's population, most of them were female migrant workers, many of whom were unmarried. As of the end of 2013, Guangzhou registered a registered population of 6.867 million. According to a certain rate of missed entry, the actual floating population in Guangzhou is about 8.37 million. This data has already surpassed the resident population. The latest statistics show that the resident population of Guangzhou is 8.32 million. Among them, Baiyun District, Panyu District and Tianhe District have a floating population of more than one million. There are 1.117 million registered migrants in Panyu District, and the floating household registration area involves 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government. In terms of sex ratio, men are slightly more, accounting for 53.5% of the total; women account for 46.5% of the total. Among the floating population of Panyu, the proportion of children and the elderly is extremely small, accounting for 0.49% under 15 years old, 1.68% over 60 years old, and about 10% under junior college education."

In recent years, Guangzhou blacks have been involved in some public security problems in Guangzhou, causing some dissatisfaction among the people of Guangzhou. In response to the \"three non-issues\" issue, the public security organs have established four foreign-related comprehensive law enforcement teams, translation volunteer service teams, and investigations into the \"three non-\" foreign professional teams and the four teams of foreign-related management grassroots service teams; Since the beginning of the year, Guangzhou has established 75 \"Foreigner Management Service Workstations\" in a community of more than 200 foreigners, and has been vigorously cracking down on the \"three non-\" foreigners.

          "trans_context": "The history of Guangzhou has begun with the Qin Dynasty. It is characterized by maritime commerce and has a history of capital construction in the \"Three Emperors and Ten Emperors\". The history of written records in Guangzhou can be traced back to 214 BC, and there was a “Bai Yueren” activity in the Neolithic Age. The history of human activities has exceeded 4,000 years. During the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, Lingnan refers to the present two Guangdong and northern parts of Vietnam. The people who lived here were called South Vietnam. In the Zhou Dynasty, the \"Bai Yue\" people here and the Chu people in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have come and gone. In 219 BC, Qin Wang sent the slaughter as the main general and Zhao Wei as the deputy, and led 500,000 troops to attack Lingnan. The slaughter was killed by the Vietnamese, and the resignation was appointed as the mainstay. In 214 BC, Qin unified Lingnan, the site of the Nanyue people gathered between Baiyun Mountain and the Pearl River to build Panyu City, the beginning of the establishment of administrative districts and city construction in Guangzhou. In 204 BC, at the end of the Qin Dynasty, Nanhai County, Zhao Zhao, established Nanyue State and settled in Panyu. It is the first time to establish a capital city in the Lingnan area. During the Jin and Northern and Southern Dynasties, the war in the Central Plains was frequent, and the Han people moved into the relatively stable Jiangnan area. A certain number of Han people moved into Lingnan, which promoted the economic development of Guangzhou. The overseas trade center was transferred from Guangzhou to Guangzhou, and the maritime trade of Guangzhou Port became increasingly prosperous until Guangzhou maintained its status as a maritime trading center during the Qing Dynasty. Yuan Chao set Guangzhou Road. In the early years of the Ming Dynasty, Guangzhou Road was changed to Guangzhou. In the 22nd year of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, Guangzhou was once the only trading port open to Western countries. It was called \"one trade\" and the 13th line of Guangzhou monopolized most of China's foreign trade. Guangzhou became the third largest city in the world at that time. In 1842, the Qing government was defeated in the Opium War, and was forced to sign the \"Nanjing Treaty\" to open five places, such as Guangzhou, as a trading port. After Hong Kong was ceded to the United Kingdom, it became a free port and gradually replaced Guangzhou as a distribution center for goods. Britain and France occupied Shamian Island for more than 80 years since 1861."

Satellite Chinese, Star TV, CETV and global music TV. Since Hong Kong TV uses Cantonese, the language is similar and entertaining, and with fewer local TV channels, poor signal and short playing time in the 1990s, the four free TV channels in Hong Kong have been used by the public since then. Widely received and quickly spread throughout the Pearl River Delta. Local TV stations began to purchase a large number of Hong Kong dramas in the late 1980s, which further promoted the popularity of Hong Kong TV in Guangzhou. However, the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at that time considered that Hong Kong TV was a \"reactionary propaganda\" and demanded that the Guangdong authorities severely crack down on and severely punish private viewers. This situation did not improve until the first secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, Ren Zhongyi. However, after the June 4th incident, the authorities began to review Hong Kong TV. The four channels were incorporated into the cable television network in the 1990s, and the authorities sought to give the public a clear view of the unfiltered original signals. If the Administration considers that the programme is not appropriate, the signal will be interrupted in a number of ways, including the playback of pre-recorded Hong Kong government promotional videos or other previously recorded programmes of the same television station. In addition, the two cable companies will also insert advertisements on these overseas channels for profit. However, due to frequent frequency and inappropriate time, the Guangzhou media has repeatedly followed up the report, but the situation has not improved much."

Diet has a special status in the lives of people in Guangzhou, which makes the city's annual catering retail sales amounting to tens of billions of yuan, and per capita consumption ranks first among major cities in mainland China. Guangzhou also holds a “Food Festival” every year to promote the development of the catering industry. Traditional local dishes are mainly based on Guangfu cuisine. Since Guangzhou is located in the Pearl River Estuary, seafood is also a common dish. The wholesale market of yellow sand aquatic products is a hot spot for seafood. Guangzhou is a subtropical monsoon maritime climate, and the climate is hot and humid, and it is easy to get angry.

All private or church schools were merged and rescinded after liberation, and some of them moved to Macao and Hong Kong. In 1954, Guangzhou changed its jurisdiction to the city. In 1956, the authorities began a public-private partnership to ensure that all privately-run businesses were confiscated, and some of them moved to Macau and Hong Kong. After the Cultural Revolution took place in 1966, the city was in a state of chaos, the economy was almost paralyzed, and historical sites were destroyed. A large number of place names and trade names have also been renamed. For example, Lianxiang Building has been changed to \"Dongsheng Building\", Liuyi Road, Chaotian Road and Mishi Road Sanlu Road, and it has become a north-south \"Chaoyang Road\", etc., like Beijing Road has not been restored to its original name. In October 1984, it was classified as a separate city for national plans. In 2000, Huadu and Panyu were revoked and became the city of Guangzhou. Later, it gradually added and transformed from Conghua, Zengcheng, Conghua and Zengcheng to become county-level cities in Guangzhou. In 1998, the Administration proposed a development plan of \"a small change in a year, a change in three years, a major change in a decade\". \"Guangfo and the same city\" became a hot topic in the 21st century. TV stations, radio stations, and telecommunications landed on each other and drafted to cancel the toll stations in the two places. The exchanges between the two peoples will be closer in the future. On November 11, 2001, the Ninth National Games of the People's Republic of China opened in Guangzhou. In November 2010, the 16th Asian Games was held in Guangzhou, and another successful large-scale sports event was held in Guangzhou."

The first major event of the International Football Association was the 1908 London Olympic Football Elimination. The competition was very successful. The competition was for professional athletes from all over the world. The Olympic Games later restricted the participation of professional players and had a strict inspection mechanism for the healthy body of the players. In 1912, those who had cut the cecum were prohibited from joining. During the First World War, the heads of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland withdrew from the International Football Association and declared that they were unwilling to fight against the enemy and later rejoined.

In 2004, the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the International Football Association was held. In April 2004, the organization announced that its total revenue will reach 1.64 billion U.S. dollars between 2003 and 2006, and the total profit will reach 144 million U.S. dollars. On May 20, 2004, in order to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of the International Football Association, the Brazilian national football team and the French national football team held a commemorative match, and the two sides shook hands with a 0-0 handshake."

At the same time, there are some problems: the decision of the International Football Association is often opposed by European countries. The 2022 World Cup decided to make the European football in vain in November. However, it is still not feasible for the FIFA to listen to European countries. The price of the World Cup broadcast is too high. I didn’t need to spend money before. The International Football Association limits the brands of players and fans who drink and wear clothes. The International Football Association explicitly prohibits racial discrimination, but does not discriminate against state-level organizations that have racist speech or behavior on the grounds that they do not meet the standards of disciplinary action, which makes anti-racism a slogan. Institutions only have $4 billion in advertising revenue and TV rights, but the International Football Association says the remaining amount will be used as a reserve. The 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids were unfair, and there were many problems in the host country. The bribery incident that was revealed in 2015 shows the problems arising from the aforementioned situation."

The Secretary of the Football Association of the United Kingdom, Horne, said: \"This is an important day in the history of football development.\" The goal line technology will be introduced in the December 2012 World Club Cup in Japan and will be ready for the 2013 Federation. Cup match. Goal line technology is also used in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The Premier League Committee said it will engage with companies developing two technologies to introduce goal line technology in the Premier League as soon as possible. It is reported that the course renting a set of goal line technology requires $250,000. At the time, FIFA President Blatter said: \"The goal line technology will ensure 99% of the rulings are correct. Real life can't be 100% correct, but in the past, we didn't even have the goal line technology. I want to say here. \"Thank you, Lampard.\" Blatter thanked the English player because he scored a goal in the game against the German football team in the South African World Cup two years ago. This has led Blatter to switch from the goal line technology to the goal line technology, and many coaches, players, and media have been calling for the introduction of goal line technology. The International Football Council approves the goal line technique and the addition of the door line referee. It is not mandatory to use the goal line technique or the door line referee in the football match. The International Football Council also stressed that the goal of the goal line technology for whether or not to score goals will not be displayed on the stadium screen."

The excellent compression algorithm makes it possible to ensure the image quality to a certain extent while making the volume small. Multiple frames can be inserted for animation. A transparent color can be set to produce an effect that the object appears above the background. Because it uses 8-bit compression, it can only process up to 256 colors, so it should not be applied to true color pictures.

The logic program description block defines the size, aspect ratio, and color depth of the image plane for all subsequent images. It also indicates whether the following is a \"global\" color table. The global color table forms a 24-bit red, green and blue palette. If the latter image does not have its own \"local\" palette, then the global color table is the default palette. Subsequent data appears as a \"graphic\" or \"dedicated\" block. A graphics block typically contains one or more bitmap images, or it may be overlaid text. Dedicated blocks either contain a dedicated application code or contain a non-printable comment. The last tail block indicates a byte with a value of 59 indicating that the data stream has ended. Note: The image interchange format data stream in the file may not contain any bitmap data at all.

          "trans_context": "A function is a correspondence between two sets in mathematics: each element in the input value set can correspond to an element in a unique set of output values. The distribution of temperature can also be expressed as a function, with time and place as parameters input, at which point the temperature of the place is used as an output. There are many ways to express functions. For example, the analytical method expresses the correspondence between two variables by mathematical expression. The image method uses the function graph on the coordinate system to express the correspondence between two variables. The list method expresses two relations in a table. The correspondence between variables. In modern mathematics, the set of all input values of a function is called the domain of the function, and the set of output values is called the upper domain or the corresponding domain. The value range refers specifically to the output value set of the function, that is, the upper domain contains the value domain, and the value domain is a subset of the upper domain. Usually the input value is called the parameter or parameter of the function, and the output value is called the value of the function. The function converts a valid input value into a unique output value, and the same input always corresponds to the same output, but the reverse is not necessarily true. A function can be abstracted into a mathematical relationship. Due to the generality of its definition, almost all branches of mathematics are basic concepts. In most areas of mathematics, the term correspondence, mapping, and transformation are usually synonymous functions. However, in some cases these terms may have other specific meanings. For example, in topology, a map is sometimes defined as a continuous function."

          "trans_context": "The mathematical term function is used by Leibniz in 1694 to describe an amount associated with a curve, such as the slope of a curve or a point on a curve. The function that Leibniz refers to is now called a derivable function, which is something that ordinary people other than mathematicians generally come into contact with. For the derivable function, its limits and derivatives can be discussed. The two describe the relationship between the change of the output value of the function and the change of the input value, which is the basis of calculus. The Chinese word \"function\" was translated by Qing Dynasty mathematician Li Shanlan. Its \"Algebra\" book explains: \"Where the variable in this variable is a function of the other.\" In 1718, John Bernoulli defined the function as \"a function of a variable is an amount consisting of this variable and a constant in any way.\" In 1748, Bernoulli's student Euler was introduced in \"Infinity Analysis\". The book says: \"A function of a variable is an analytical expression consisting of the variable and some number or constant in any way.\" In 1775, Euler proposed a definition of the function in the book Principles of Differential Studies: \"If some quantity depends on other quantities in the following way, that is, when the latter changes, the former itself changes, then The former amount is a function of the latter amount.” The mathematicians of the 19th century began to formalize the various branches of mathematics. The Wizards Initiative puts calculus on the basis of arithmetic rather than geometry, and this claim tends to be defined by Euler."

The number of all computable functions from integer to integer is countable because the number of all possible algorithms is countable.

Although legislation protecting women’s rights has been approved, men, women and children continue to be forced to sexually exploit their personal liberty and other illicit trafficking, most of which are trafficked to the Balkans, other Eastern European countries and even Afghanistan in Asia. It is not enough to provide measures to protect women from domestic violence. A constitutional amendment was made to abolish the death penalty. Freedom of speech has been restricted and the seizure of opposition politicians is serious. The human rights and security situation in the neighboring Nyst River Republic is even worse.

From empiricalism, it extensively studies all aspects of life, including the origin, evolution, distribution, structure, development, function, behavior, and interaction with the environment. Relationships, as well as taxonomy and so on. Modern biology is a large and eclectic field that consists of many branches and branches. However, despite the breadth of biology, there are some general and unified concepts that govern everything and learn to integrate it into a single, coherent field. In general, organisms use cells as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of inheritance, and evolution is the engine that drives the synthesis and creation of new species. Today, people also understand that all living organisms consume and convert energy to regulate the internal environment to maintain stable and important living conditions. The branch of biology is defined by the scale of graduate objects and by the methods used to study them: biochemistry examines the basic chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the intricate relationships between biomolecules; botany studies plant biology; Cell biology examines the basic building blocks of all life, cells; physiologically examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems of organisms; evolutionary biology examines the process of producing diversity of life; and ecological investigations How organisms interact in their environment. Ultimately, it can achieve the purpose of treating and diagnosing genetic diseases, increasing crop yields, improving human life, and protecting the environment. The five foundations of modern biology are also the main research directions: cytology, evolution, genetics, homeostasis, and energy."

I once enrolled in a doctoral program at Hitotsubashi University and later dropped out of school. The New York Times reported that Ito became the head of the media lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This appointment is unusual because Ito has studied at two institutions but has not completed his studies. Ito Iichi officially took office on September 1, 2011. Nicholas Negroponte, founder and former executive director of the MIT Media Lab, believes this option will integrate the media into the world of Ito. According to the Asian Science Journal, Ito Yuichi looks forward to his future at the MIT Media Lab. He prefers to use \"learning\" to summarize it compared to \"education.\""

The latter said that the law began to be universal in modern times. As the written language of Chinese or Chinese, Chinese characters are the main characters that have been used for the longest period of time. It is also the only one of the major characters in ancient times. In ancient times, ancient Egypt, Babylon and ancient Indian characters have long since died.

In modern times, Western civilizations in a strong position began to enter East Asia, and various countries in the entire Chinese character culture circle set off a trend of learning the West. Some people insist on the tradition of Chinese characters, and they also advocate giving up the use of Chinese characters. These advocates abandon the Chinese character movement theory of \"Chinese character backwardness\", the content is: compared with Western Pinyin, Chinese characters are cumbersome and clumsy. Especially before the modern PCs were not universalized, because Chinese characters could not be written by typewriters, they had to use the typeface of giant typesetting houses, which means that Chinese characters have become a bottleneck in education and informationization. However, after the modernization of personal computers, Chinese characters can be input through personal computers, and such statements are not convincing. Many Chinese-language countries have implemented different levels of Chinese character simplification in the form of political promotion, and even have completely attempted to use pinyin.

In the Eastern Han Dynasty, Xu Shen elaborated on the principle of the construction of Chinese characters in the \"Six Books\" in the \"Speaking of the Words\": pictograms, pointing things, meeting meanings, sounds, turning notes, and borrowing. Pictographic modeling is based on the appearance of the object. The so-called \"painting its objects, following the body\" is also. The words \"day, month, mountain, water, etc.\" were the first to depict the patterns of the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the water, and gradually evolved into the current shape. Refers to the way of expressing abstract things. The so-called \"all things are thought of\" is also. If a person writes \"up\" on it, people write \"below\" under it, and some people call it an abstract pictogram. The idea of creating a word is to combine the two roots to create a new meaning. For example, \"day\" and \"month\" are combined, that is, daylight plus moonlight becomes \"bright\". The word \"person\" and \"word\" are combined with the word \"letter\", which means what people have said in the past; there is a belief that this person is very much obeying what he has said. Shape sound is a sound that is unique to a particular shape in a text. For example: Hu, this word can also be a sound, combined with different attribute components, the table has different meanings such as butterfly, lake, dragonfly, coral, dragonfly, etc., and express different things with the same pronunciation elements. However, the shape of the sound, but also because of the ancient and modern language phonological changes, many ancient similar sound words in today's Mandarin has no common phonemes, such as, worm."

The Han Dynasty Xu Shen explained: \"Build a class, agree to accept, test, always.\" \"Longevity\" says that \"old\" and \"examination\" are the same, meaning the same, that is, the so-called \"older test, the examiner is old.\" The book \"Da Ya·Pu Pu\" of the Book of Songs also said: \"Zhou Wangshou test.\" Su Shi’s \"Qu Yuan Ta Shi\" also has the phrase \"Who the ancients did not die, why should they be more than a test.\" The \"test\" is \"old\", and it is particularly important to note that the philosophers of future generations have also explained a lot to the above definition of Xu Shen. Among them, there are three categories of \"transformation, transposition, and righteousness\". However, some of these three arguments are not comprehensive enough. The contemporary ancient writer Lin Biao also explained that \"transfer\" is a physical record with two pronunciations and meanings completely different. Two words. For example, \"Mr. and Women\" and \"Mother and Daughter\" in Oracle and so on. In short, borrow a word to express something else. Generally speaking, there is a new thing that cannot be described, and a new word is expressed by borrowing a root with a close pronunciation or an approximate attribute. For example: \"again\", originally referred to as the right hand, but was later used as a different meaning. Smell, the intention is to listen to things with your ears. For example, \"University ‧ Chapter 7\" has \"turned a blind eye, listened to it, and ate it without knowing its taste\", but was later borrowed into a verb of olfaction. Summarize the above six ancient books, the first two, the \"word-making method\"; the two items, the \"group word method\"; the latter two, \"use the word method\" also. These six principles are the theory of words that the ancient philologists have summed up. The rules governing the formation of Chinese characters are long-term evolutions, not created by any one."

He believes that Xu Shen only uses Xiaoyan and Yiwen as reference and does not understand Oracle. The book uses Oracle as the source of Chinese characters, reinterpreting Chinese characters, and believes that the meaning of Chinese characters is more than 80% of the number of Chinese characters. There is no such thing as \"meaning and shape\". From the perspective of understanding, the \"Phonetic Word\" is analyzed. As a result, the so-called sound of the word is completely ideographic, and it is considered that the ancient man-made characters are very particular. For example, the word \"lizard\" refers to a snake that can be broken on a tree. \"蟋\" means that it is known and extended to a regular reptile. \"Liz\" and \"蟋\" are not interchangeable. It is to create words. It is determined that the word-making method is six kinds of pictograms, indications, referentials, intentions, sounds, and marks. Among them, there are two new ways of making words and symbols. Schematic, that is, a schematic representation of the meaning of the word. Graphically represent features, abstract things, event processes, etc., such as \"use\" as a schematic diagram of drilling wells, to introduce the meaning of use, to form the words \"甫\", \"甬\", \"周\". This method can explain the origin of more Chinese characters. The mark is composed of incomplete characters or words with no specific meaning. For example, the word \"by\" is simplified by \"胄\", and \"胄\" is simplified by \"胤\". \"胤\" is interpreted as a descendant of the descendants. Therefore, \"by\" is the meaning of the source and the source."

In the Eastern Han Dynasty, Xu Shen's \"Speaking of the Words\" said: \"The book of Cangjie was written at the beginning, and it was a pictogram of the class. Therefore, it is the text, and then the sound of the word is the word. \"Zheng Zhengxuan's \"Graphic Book\" cloud: \"Individualism is the text, and the combination is the word.\" In this article, the modern term is called the root part. The Chinese character is the expression of the idea. It is necessary to combine the required parts in one square and synthesize thousands of words. Zheng Xie's collection, there are three hundred and thirty texts based on the shape, known as the shape of the mother, the sound-based text has a total of eight hundred and seventy, called the initials, a total of 1,200. However, Zheng Yu's consonant mother has been lost. In modern times, Professor Zhou He reorganized the word set of 22,394 words in the second episode of the Chinese information exchange code, and found that there are 869 initials and 265 forms of Chinese characters, totaling 1,134. Form mother: Zheng Yi's collection, there are three hundred and thirty. The modern research and finishing is 265. Initials: Zheng Yi's collection, there are eight hundred and seventy. The modern research is 869. The final component, which is disassembled, is the smallest unit of Chinese characters: strokes. The strokes of Chinese characters cannot be separated from the six basic strokes of \"point\", \"horizontal\", \"vertical\", \"撇\", \"捺\" and \"折折\", as well as \"提提\". Taking calligraphy as an example, there are many different ways of writing various strokes, especially the folds. When writing Chinese characters, the direction of the strokes and the order of appearance, that is, \"stroke\", is relatively fixed. The basic rule is that from top to bottom, from left to right, first horizontally and then vertically, first squatting and then squatting, first outside and then inside, first outside and then inside and then sealing, first between the middle and the back. The stroke order of different Chinese characters may vary."

          "trans_context": "Chinese characters are a common writing system for multiple languages, each word representing a syllable or a few syllables. In addition, in Japanese and in various Chinese, the pronunciation is divided into \"sound reading\" and \"training\". In ancient Chinese, there was a case of multiple syllables in Chinese characters. From the Middle Ages, it was reduced to one word and one syllable. In modern standard Chinese, it is determined by an initial, a final and a tone, and more than 1,300 syllables are actually used. Due to the large number of Chinese characters, there is a clear homophone phenomenon; at the same time, there is a polyphonic word, called a polyphonic word or a broken word. This situation is generally consistent with various Chinese dialects. When other minorities borrow Chinese characters, there are also multiple syllables. Korean Chinese characters are roughly one-word pronunciation, and there are trainings, but they are not commonly used today. Japanese has many syllables in the pronunciation of Chinese characters, such as the country and the flesh. There are also monosyllabic cymbals such as empty cymbals. In addition, there are many words due to training, sound reading, and different sounds in different situations. In addition to Japan, there are still a small number of multi-syllable words in other Chinese characters, such as \"浬\", \"嗧\", \"瓩\", \"吋\", \"哩\" and so on. It is widely used by Taiwan's official institutions or the private sector. It is not used in China because of the official abolition, but the average person also understands its meaning."

          "trans_context": "The earliest method of phonetic transcription was to read the law and the direct method. If you read the law, you should use the word near to the phonetic transcription. Xu Shen’s narration solution uses this method of phonetic transcription, such as \"Hey, shoot, and read.\" The direct method is to use another Chinese character to indicate the pronunciation of the Chinese character. For example, in the words \"women say their own content,\" use the \"talker\" to make phonetic transcriptions. Both of the above methods have inherently imperfect places. Some words have no homonyms or homophones that are too cold, which makes it difficult to play the role of phonetic, such as \"socks sounds\". During the Wei and Jin Dynasties, the anti-cutting method was developed, which is said to be influenced by Sanskrit using pinyin. The pronunciation of Chinese characters can be marked by the inverse cut method, that is, the initials of the first word and the finals of the second word and the tones are combined to make phonetic sounds, so that all Chinese pronunciations are possible to be combined. For example, \"practice, langdian cut\", that is, \"practice\" is pronounced as the initials of \"Lang\" and the vowels and tones of \"Dian\"."

Phonetic symbols have always been part of Taiwan's official teaching, and students are required to master before learning Chinese characters.

This feature makes the literature of the next millennium, not the same as the Western world that uses the phonetic alphabet, the word disparity is too wide, but it also causes the difficulty of inferring ancient rhymes. Special Chinese phonology must be used to speculate that they are in ancient Chinese. And the pronunciation of Middle Chinese. Pan Wuyun and French scholar Shagar believe that before the Han Dynasty, some Chinese characters might represent the pronunciation of two syllables, that is, these words have secondary syllables and main syllables. Chinese characters are the smallest unit of Chinese composition, and most of them can be used as single words. With the development of language, there are also many words or words. There are many vernaculars in modern times. They can be roughly divided into three categories: synonymous compound words: \"encounter\" and \"learning\"; antisense compound words: \"winning defeat\" It is a common occurrence of the military; the compound of the partiality: there is no \"movement.\" However, accurately mastering its complex forms and usage has become a burden to learn Chinese. There are about tens of thousands of commonly used words in Chinese, and the total vocabulary is more than one million. The huge number may make people deterred. In ancient Chinese, the use of words is more precise and efficient than the use of words. For example, Mr. Zhu Bangfu advocates the use of the \"character\" retro."

In the early days, the number of words in the Chinese character system was insufficient, and many things were expressed in the form of false words, which made the expression of the words more ambiguous. In order to improve the clarity of the expression, Chinese characters have experienced a stage of gradual complexity and a large increase in the number of words. In the past, it was backward in the study and teaching of the basic factors of Chinese characters. It is difficult to learn from word-to-word learning. The more Chinese characters are, the more difficult it is to learn. The trend of forming new words is more conservative, and there is no corresponding information processing technology. So there are many single The meaning of Chinese is expressed in words, such as common double words, so the development of modern writing tends to create new words rather than create new ones. The Chinese character bit means that the different words of the same word are calculated as the same word, instead of being calculated as different words. For example, \"enough\" and \"enough\" are considered different variants of the same Chinese character, not two Chinese characters. According to statistics, the number of Chinese characters is roughly 26,500. Later, the compiled dictionary received more and more words, and the vast majority of the increase was actually a word bit variant rather than a word position. The \"Kangxi Dictionary\" with 42174 words is only about 1000 words less than the 85,568 Chinese characters."

Different dialects and even languages use Chinese characters as a common writing system. In ancient Japan, the Korean Peninsula, Vietnam, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Lanfang Republic in Borneo, Chinese characters were the only system of official documents in the country, and Chinese characters played an important role in the dissemination and sharing of civilization in history."

For example, shooting tigers: it is a guessing riddle, also called a light tiger, which has a close relationship with Chinese characters. The old shooting tiger can be roughly divided into two categories, one is the literati shooting tiger, the mystery is deep, the mystery is complex and diverse, the mystery is mostly the original sentence in the four books and five classics; the first is the city riddle, the mystery is very popular. Shooting the tiger is an important event of the Lantern Festival. Hewen: Chinese folks often write a few words with auspicious meanings as a word to pray for good fortune. Common essays such as \"Lucky Treasures\", \"囍\", \"Golden Miles\", etc. Homophones: Chinese people like to use the homophone characteristics of Chinese characters to take auspicious meanings with homophonic words. For example, the bat's \"bat\" homophonic is a happy \"blessing\", so the common stone pillars in the temple are engraved with bats. The \"beast\" of the beast is also homophonic as \"shou\". Jiujiu chilling map: A folklore in northern China wrote nine double-hooks in the ninth season of the year. A stroke fills the color and completes the full picture by the end of the number nine. Flowers and Birds: Some folk artists use some flowers and birds to spell Chinese characters. The details are some flowers and birds. The whole picture is a word. The art form of calligraphy and painting is called flower and bird. It is a kind of Colorful flower and bird insect fish combination calligraphy. In China, it can only be seen in the Spring Festival temple fairs and in some festival gatherings. Flowers and birds have become a street art in Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Most of the early bird paintings were written with some auspicious words to pray for Geely. The bird paintings that are now seen in the temple fairs are mainly written by the customer's name, and the purchaser's purpose is gradually changed from praying for good luck to hunting. Measured words: a type of character that draws Chinese characters or writes Chinese characters, and then uses the shape, sound, meaning, parts, pen, pen, split, etc. of the characters, even the pendulum when writing, the ink At that time, the environment and other factors made an explanation or judged good or bad."

In the history of Chinese characters, new characters are constantly being grouped. At present, various Chinese characters are not stereotyped in a certain era, but are gradually developed in response to the needs of the times. For example, the word \"person\" appeared in the Shang Dynasty, and the words \"concave\" and \"convex\" appeared only in the Tang Dynasty. In addition, different industries will also create words because of the need for words. For example, Chinese traditional music uses subtractive spectrum and work rule spectrum on the score. Since the mid-nineteenth century, many Chinese and Latin languages have been published in Asia and the West. Now, the Chinese Pinyin program is the most widely used and accepted method of Chinese characters. And Westin Pinyin has a long history and is still used for Taiwanese names and place names."

Taiwan also uses so-called variants such as \"Taiwan\" and \"Taiwan\", \"Body\" and \"Body\", and \"Learning\" and \"Learning\". In 1956, mainland China published a list of variants, abolishing a large number of variants, but later recovered some variants for various reasons. For example, \"Yu\" was abolished as a variant of \"Yu\", but it was restored to the Normative Word in the \"Modern Chinese General Word List\" published in 1988. Because the surnames exist in and at the same time, they should not be merged. In addition, the choice of different characters in different regions is different. For example, South Korea uses the earliest appearance of various characters in Chinese characters as the standard standard. Therefore, in the standard of Korean kanji, take \"甛\" instead of \"sweet\", take \"幇\" instead of \"help\", take \"畵\" instead of \"painting\"."

Although the Chinese characters can be disassembled into different parts from the glyphs, they are divided into radicals or Too many radicals, not only can not achieve the purpose of simplifying the input, but it is more cumbersome. Therefore, considering the Chinese character sound, the Chinese character input is divided into a small number of voice element combinations, which can achieve the step of simplifying the input. Because it is the pronunciation of the pronunciation of Chinese characters must be clear, some uncommon words or do not know the pronunciation of Chinese characters will be very difficult, which limits the input of Chinese characters to a certain extent. Since the typewriter keyboard is designed for European and American characters, the Chinese character input problem is not considered in the design itself. It is often more difficult to input Chinese characters than to input the pinyin text. Chinese characters have not entered the computer Chinese information processing stage without the popularity of Chinese typewriters. In the early days of computer invention, Chinese characters were able to adapt to the problems of the computer age. Scholars who supported the Latinization of Chinese characters even used this as a justification. With the emergence of various Chinese input methods, the computer input, storage and output technologies of Chinese characters have been basically solved, which greatly improves the efficiency of Chinese writing, publishing and information retrieval. At present, there are thousands of Chinese input methods, mainly including two types of voice input and form input, and there are also two.

The unification of the text has effectively promoted the cultural communication among different language groups, played an important role in the unification of China and the cultural exchanges of East Asian countries, and is rare in the history of world literature. The development of Chinese characters has undergone many different evolutions. In the early Chinese character system, the number of words is very small. The monographs of pictographic and referential things are the main ones. A large number of things are represented by common false words, which makes the expression of words more ambiguous. For example, the \"text\" of the pre-Qin and the function of the new word \"pattern\" of later generations represent the laws and patterns that constitute various kinds of affairs, not only the texts of the characters, but also the flowers \"text\" of the beasts and the weaving of the cloths. \"Text\", finger refers to \"text\" and other meanings. Except for the special cases of \"concave\" and \"convex\" until the Tang Dynasty, most of the pictograms have been shaped very early, and they have become the basis of the next-generation vocal group."

The \"gold\" was refined into \"gold\", \"silver\", \"copper\", \"iron\" and so on. Emperor Wen of the Emperor Yang Jian was originally a follower of the country. However, because of the unstable meaning of the word \"随\", the word \"辶\" was removed and the word \"隋\" was used as the country code. During the Tang Dynasty and Wu Zhou, Wu Zetian made the name \"曌\" according to the meaning of \"Sun and Moon\". At the same time, the invented text also includes 圀, 瞾, 囝, and the like.

For example, with the introduction of \"beer\" into China, how to express it in Chinese characters is a problem. Originally translated into leather wine, it was not appropriate. In 1910, the word \"beer\" was created - translated as \"beer\". Many of the words used in modern and modern chemical nouns are newly-created Chinese characters. There are many forms of sound words, and there are also vocal and anti-cut words. Among the chemical elements, the metallic elements and non-metallic elements which are solid at normal temperature are generally surrounded by \"gold\" and \"stone\", and the Chinese characters similar to the syllables in the corresponding English names are pronounced next to the sound, such as \"magnesium\". The words \"aluminum\", \"selenium\" and \"碲\"; the elements of gas at normal temperature are from \"qi\", such as \"氦\", \"fluorine\", etc.; \"mercury\" and \"bromine\" are liquid at normal temperature, from \"water\" \".\" Some chemical elements are related to their nature and function. For example, \"hydrogen\" means that its weight is \"light\", \"oxygen\" has the meaning of \"nourishing life\" and \"chlorine\" has \"green\" meaning. The groups formed by the hydrogenation of some non-metallic elements are often changed to \"gold\" and \"month\" according to their properties, such as \"ammonium\", \"amine\", \"鏻\", \"phosphine\", \"鉮\", \"胂\" And the like, respectively, indicate that the corresponding protonated hydride and the hydrogen in the hydride molecule are replaced by a hydrocarbon group, and the tone is changed from the original word. In thermodynamics, the related phonetic words are from the \"fire\" to the shape, such as \"焓\", \"entropy\" and so on. In organic chemistry, commonly used compounds such as \"酉\", \"艹\" and \"月\" are commonly used, such as \"alcohol\", \"aldehyde\", \"benzene\", \"naphthalene\", \"肟\", \"nitrile\" and the like. Some groups often take the name of their constituent elements and synthesize them with the radicals of the words. The pronunciation is synthesized by two parts of the word, similar to the inverse cut. Such as \"hydrocarbon\", \"carbonyl\", \"巯\", \"hydroxy\" and so on. Among the hydrocarbons, the alkane, alkene and alkyne are both vocal and vocal, and the sounds are taken from \"end\", \"thin\" and \"lack\" respectively, indicating their different saturations."

Editors and posterity evaluations are as follows: Zhao Erzhen: It is the leader of the Daxie vertebral wheel, not a book. Jin Liang: The history of the manuscript is not a fixed version. Fortunately, when you don’t write a school survey, you will be fortunate for future revisions. Zhonghua Book Company: Although the book was compiled after the Revolution of 1911, the editors basically stood in the position of the Qing Dynasty to write a history. Because they are in the hands of each other, they are not enough to take care of each other. They have not been carefully revised after the completion of the manuscript. They are not serious in proofreading at the time of publication. They are different in style, complicated and simple, and even mistakes in years, facts, names, and place names are often visible. Dai Yi: Most of the cultivators are old-agers in the Qing Dynasty. They are very attached to the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, many of them are against the revolution, the martyrdom, and the Qing dynasty. Secondly, the archives of the Qing dynasty were not cleaned up at the time. The historical cultivators could only use the original archives according to the manuscripts and related historical records in the original National History Museum, so the value was less."

The mission of the network is to provide ground support for deep space exploration missions, specifically: determining the detector execution orbit; receiving-processing detector detection information and engineering telemetry information; transmitting uplink commands and data to the detector, and controlling the detector operation. status. Features: The interstellar topology is not fixed - the need to establish an autonomous network; the interstellar environment is complex - the need to develop intelligent detectors and over-the-horizon communication; the network's space base and ground segments are asymmetric, using different networks Technology, etc.; information delay, intermittent communication. Architectural research includes many aspects. Interstellar Internet is a brand new network structure that will ensure that the Earth communicates and explores all other planets around the clock, so its topology is the first consideration; StarCraft needs to consider establishing a stable range of the interstellar range. The backbone network, the transmission of interstellar long-distance information, including the study of network protocols; the interstellar Internet will include several local networks, each of which has different functions to be completed, each node in the network The functions and structure are also different; the security mechanisms and authentication mechanisms of the interstellar Internet should be considered. Advantages: The spatial communication distance is relatively short and the delay is small - relying on the device to be forwarded by the central station of the tested planet; the number of detectors is large and the types are large - it can detect the tested planet more comprehensively and solve the intermittent communication problem."

The label file format format has been widely supported in the industry. Such formats are supported by image processing applications, desktop printing and page layout applications, scanning, faxing, word processing, optical character recognition and other applications. The label file format was originally designed to achieve a common scan image format for desktop scanner vendors in the mid-1980s, rather than each vendor using its own proprietary format. In the beginning, the label file format was just a binary image format, because the desktop scanner at the time could only handle this format. As the capabilities of the scanner become more powerful and the disk space of the desktop computer grows larger, the label image format gradually supports grayscale images and color images."

The tag can indicate the basic geometry of the image, such as the size of the image, or define how the image data is arranged, or whether various image compression options are used. For example, the label file format can include JPEG and run length encoded compressed images. The tag image format file can also contain a vector-based clipping region. The ability to store images in a distortion-free format makes label file format files an effective method of image archiving. The label file format file can be edited and then re-stored without loss of compression. Other tabbed format file options include multiple layers or multiple pages. Although it is today a widely accepted standard format, its extensibility brings many compatibility issues when the label file format first appeared. Programmers can freely define new tags and options, but not all implementations can support all of these created tags. As a result, one of its minimal features is integrated into the \"this\" tag image format, even though today's large number of tag image format files and the code that reads them are based on simple 32-bit uncompressed images."

In the semi-presidential state, the division of the presidency and the prime minister's powers, according to their national conditions, implements the \"legalization of legality\" measures, but the president's power is generally larger than the prime minister. The most typical example is France. Others such as Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and the Republic of China can also be regarded as semi-presidential. In the member-state state, the \"Swiss Federal President\" is similar in law to the presidential system. It is the head of state and government; but its actual power and status are no higher than those of other members, just like the head of state under the parliamentary system. Only Switzerland and San Marino are implementing this system today. In a socialist country, the head of state is generally not called the president. Because of the reason for the one-party rule, its status and power cannot match the top leaders of the ruling party, and some heads of state or even virtual heads of state. The People's Republic of China, Vietnam, and Laos refer to their heads of state as presidents of the country, and Cuba, East Germany, etc. as the chairman of the State Council. The socialist countries that used the \"president\" as the head of state were Cuba, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Yugoslavia and Poland."

At that time, Kim Il Sung was forced to inform Mao Zedong of his intention to start a war against South Korea at the request of Stalin, and Mao Zedong believed that the timing of the war was not good at this time. Stalin then telegraphed to Mao Zedong, hoping that he would transfer the strength of several divisions to the northeast and defend the line in Anton-Shenyang. Mao Zedong also asked the Soviet Union to provide weapons for several divisions. Stalin replied that the equipment problem can help solve some problems, but asked the Chinese to arrange the troops as soon as possible. Shi Zhe said that when the war broke out, Mao Zedong did not get the news in advance. However, according to scholars' research, since the 1990s, the United States and Russia have declassified the information on the Korean War about how Kim Il Sung planned the Korean War. The key information proves that the CCP's interpretation of its role is not refined. According to the fact that North Korea did not consider China's plan at the time, Mao Zedong could not know the exact date of the attack and the aggression plan, which led to the instability and sway of the relationship between the two sides after the war.

The Korean People’s Army occupied more than 90% of the North Korean region and 92% of the population in less than one and a half months. From June to July 1950, the Korean National Army lost in Seoul, Daejeon, Mokpo and Jinju. South Korea and the United Nations Army retreated to the Lodong River area near Busan. The North Korean singer’s winning streak, saying “to complete the reunification of the motherland on the anniversary of the liberation on August 15th”, launched an August offensive against the United Nations Force’s Busan ring of defensive circles in early August, and again launched an offensive in early September, but the North Korean Army At this time, the continuous combat loss was severe, so the offensive was blunt. In order to solve the encirclement of Busan, General MacArthur proposed a landing plan in Incheon. On September 15, under the command of MacArthur, the US military landed on a large scale in Incheon Port. Most of the Korean People's Army was cut off in the south of South Korea. The loss was severe and it was attacked by the North and the South. The amphibious force attacked Incheon and successfully landed. At this time, the main force of North Korea was almost all assembled in the front line of Busan. The side amphibious assault on the US military had no power to fight, and it was defeated. On September 25, the UN troops regained Seoul. On September 27th, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and President Truman agreed to MacArthur's proposal to cross the 38th parallel, but the president asked MacArthur to do so only if the main forces of the CCP and the Soviet Union would not participate in the war. On October 1, the first batch of troops in South Korea finally entered North Korea. On October 7, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution No. 376, calling for the reunification of the Korean Peninsula and authorizing the UN troops to cross the 38th parallel. On October 9, the US First Cavalry Division crossed the 38th parallel and advanced to Pyongyang. On October 19th, the US military occupied Pyongyang and the North Korean government moved to Gangwon City."

The Security Council, by high vote, adopted Resolution 82 stating that this was an aggression against South Korea in the South of South Korea and urged it to cease fire immediately. On June 27, the UN Security Council passed Resolution No. 83, demanding that the South Korean army withdraw its 38-degree line. \"It is recommended that the UN member states give the Republic of Korea assistance to defeat the armed attack in the north of the Republic of Korea and restore international peace and security in the region. \".\" Subsequently, the 21 member states of the United Nations decided to organize the \"United Nations Army\" to participate in the Korean War. Among them, the United States provided 88% of combatants and occupied a dominant position. Thus, in the name of defending peace, the civil war between the North and the South has evolved into an international military dispute involving dozens of countries. Subsequently, the Soviet Air Force began to secretly participate in the war, while the Chinese side condemned and called for a ceasefire between the two sides and maintained a certain neutrality."

On the evening of February 11, the Volunteers launched a counter-attack in Hengcheng, restrained the United Nations forces in Muping, and planned to attack the eighth division of South Korea in the northwest of Hengcheng. This opened the gap and attacked the US military defense line in the original state. The volunteers won. The Volunteers used the Hengcheng counterattack to force South Korea's third, fifth, and eighth divisions, as well as the second division of the US military and the airborne 187 regiment, to retreat to some extent, alleviating the pressure the volunteers faced on the entire battlefield. After the counter-attacks in Hengcheng, in addition to the United Nations forces in Muping, the United Nations troops on the east line showed signs of swaying across the board and began to retreat to varying degrees. On February 13, the Volunteers launched the Battle of Yupingli. General Wen Yucheng commanded eight of the five divisions, about 25,000, to launch a storm on the 23rd regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division of the US Army in the west of Hengcheng. The Freeman regiment has a group of tank squadrons, a wild cannon battalion and a French infantry battalion with a strength of about 4,500 and a strong fortification and firepower advantage. The eight regiments of the 39th, 40th, and 42nd Army of the Volunteers suffered heavy casualties, with more than 5,000 casualties. There were 1,830 casualties in the three regiments that only the 40th Army participated in the attack. Among them, almost all of the 359 regiments and three battalions of the volunteers were killed. The US military suffered 301 casualties and 42 people were missing. The US military called the Battle of Yuping as \"the Battle of Gettysburg in the Korean War\" and \"the second landing in Incheon\", which greatly encouraged the morale of the US military."

The US State Department drafted President Truman's proposal to hold a negotiation with the Chinese government, began consultations with other participating countries, and notified the United Nations Commander MacArthur on March 20, 1951; however, MacArthur issued a statement to the Chinese government on March 24: \"The enemy must now know with pain that if the United Nations forces decide to abandon the war to limit its tolerance efforts in North Korea and expand our military operations to China's coastal areas and mainland bases, this will put China at risk of military collapse. \".\" Truman hopes to avoid direct conflict with China or the Soviet Union and does not want to trigger the Third World War. A spokesperson for the China Anti-US Aid Korea General Assembly spoke of contempt for MacArthur. Truman learned that MacArthur had stated that \"this is a flagrant defiance of the order issued by me as president and supreme commander.\" \"In fact, MacArthur’s move is equivalent to using an ultimatum. Threatening the enemy is equivalent to saying that all the dominant forces of the allies can be used to attack the red China... This has happened immediately in our allies. The enquiries sent by the capitals around the world are coming.\" MacArthur is military. Victory is a priority, and many actions on the Korean peninsula have not been approved by Washington, and some even violate Washington’s decision-making."

At the meeting with the State Council, Assistant Secretary of State Dean Ruske suggested that Li Qiwei should send an invitation to the other party to participate in the peace talks by broadcasting, except for the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Hoyt Vandenberg, who expressed his opposition. The proposal was supported by other members of the JCS. The second JCS-State Council meeting quickly approved the draft and sent it to Li Qiwei. On the 29th, the revised broadcast was approved by the President and immediately sent to Li Qiwei. The US government authorized the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations General Li Qiwei to invite the DPRK and China representatives to discuss the possibility of armistice negotiations."

However, this attack was also blocked by the Korean People’s Army’s \"fire net like iron buckets\". Nor has it progressed. On September 20th, the new division commander of the 2nd Division, Major General Robert Young, ordered the 9th Regiment to participate in the Battle of the Bloodscaping to capture the 1024 and 867 highlands on either side of the Sick Ridge. The 1024 high ground was taken down, but because it was 7 kilometers away from the sad heart, the suppression of the tunnel tactics of the Korean People’s Army’s anti-slope was not very effective, and the newly replaced 15th Regiment of the Korean People’s Army held the 867 high ground. Master Yange carefully studied the attack and made a conclusion report saying \"This is a big failure\". On September 27th, he decided to suspend the attack and attack it again in early October under the new concept. Since the United Nations Army in 1951 Since the counter-attack in January, there have been many difficult attacks, but it took two weeks to capture the position and stop the attack, for the first time. At this time, the Korean People’s Army was also over-damaged and exhausted, and the position was handed over to the Chinese People’s Volunteers in order to withdraw the rest. The Chinese military has always adopted a flexible and changeable campaign of warfare against the dead and hard fights. Later, in order to return to combat, the Chinese army took the initiative to abandon this highland. The 2nd Division of the US military suffered more than 3,700 casualties. The US estimated that there were 25,000 casualties in China and North Korea. The Chinese claimed that during the summer and autumn campaigns of the Korean War in 1951, China and North Korea jointly injured more than 168,000 United Nations troops and injured more than 33,000 people. This operation forced the US to resume the armistice negotiations and abandon its original requirements. The horseshoe-shaped fortifications created by the volunteer soldiers in the battle are the prototype of the tunneling work, providing important experience for the future construction of a defense system with tunnels as the backbone."

Shortly after the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement, Fang Hushan became the president of the military academy. At this time, Park Yi-hyun was self-proclaimed as a representative of the Korean revolutionaries who returned from China, and they clashed with the ruling party. However, Park Yi-soo overestimated his ability, and most of the cadres who returned to North Korea from China ignored his entanglement. Like Jin Changde, he said bluntly to Park Yi-hyun that he relied on the party, the motherland and the people to return to China, not because he trusted Park Yi. Some people even reported directly to Kim Il Sung, saying that Park Yi-soo is an anti-Party. At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in April 1955, Park Yi-soo and Fang Hushan were expelled from the party as \"anti-Party sects.\" In his concluding remarks, Kim Il Sung pointed out that Fang Hushan was \"criticized within the party because he did not fight well at the end of the war.\" He was used by Park Yi-soo for complaints. \"The policy of non-respecting the party and the state behind the scenes\" Therefore, he was punished by expulsion from the party. In the early morning of October 14, 1952, Van Fleet, commander of the 8th Army of the United Nations, launched the battle of Shangganling north of Jinhua. The two sides carried out a tug-of-war on the surface. As a result of repeated competitions, both sides suffered heavy casualties. Forty-three days before and after, in the area of 3.7 square kilometers, more than 2.3 million rounds of shells were fired, and the soil on the ridge was blown out at least 3 meters on average. The casualties of the Chinese People’s Volunteers Army have increased, but they still relied on systematic construction of tunnels to prevent attacks by the US military. According to the statistics of the People's Republic of China, the Volunteers killed 4,838 people and injured 6,691 people. According to statistics from the United Nations military, the United Nations forces killed 1,461 people and injured more than 4,700 people."

The 64th Army undertook the task of defending the Yalu River and strategic targets and traffic lines within 75 kilometers south of the border between China and North Korea. The Soviet Air Force believed that the threat of the MiG-15 to the US bombers made the US Air Force's target of blowing up six Yalu River strategic bridges and 10 North Korean cities in November failed. The US Air Force believes that due to geopolitical restrictions, the bomber could not fly into China and resist the anti-aircraft fire from China, causing troubles in carrying out its tasks, but still successfully completed most of its tasks.

American pilots began to call this area \"Mig Corridor\", and they thought that entering this airspace would be like a melee in the back lane. The most mysterious force in the MiG corridor is the Soviet pilot. Stalin ordered the Minister of Defense, Marshal Wasilevsky, to dispatch an aviation division to China. The Soviet officers will be dressed in uniforms of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Although Stalin asked for strict confidentiality, the coalition forces actually learned about the intervention of the Soviet Union from the interception of radio communications since the Soviet Union joined the ranks of air combat. However, during the entire Korean War, the coalition forces also chose a silent attitude to prevent the war from expanding. At that time, the Chief of Staff of the US Air Force, Hoyt Vandenberg, publicly declared after returning from the Far East that \"Community China has become one of the major air force forces in the world\", deliberately holding up China's air force strength, Zhang Guan Li Dai, so as not to expose the Soviet pilots to participate in the war. The truth. In 2000, Wang Hai, former commander of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, wrote in his autobiography \"My Combat Life\": \"In the early days of the Korean War, the Chinese People's Volunteers Air Force was still quite young and weak. The air combat was mainly played by the Soviet Air Force.\""

In order to prevent China from entering the war, the United States sent 10 unarmed B-29 bombers to Guam and spread the news through the New York Times to carry out nuclear threats against China. However, in the end, the United States transferred the B-29 bomber back to the country due to domestic and foreign pressure. On October 19, 1950, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States formally proposed to study the target of implementing nuclear strikes against North Korea and China. On November 30, President Truman answered at the press conference that the United States will take all steps to contain the expansion of the Communist Party on the Korean Peninsula, including the use of atomic bombs. In early December, the US aircraft simulated a nuclear attack on the North Korean capital Pyongyang. In April 1951, nine B-29 bombers carried nuclear warheads to Guam, then flew to Okinawa and held open nuclear war exercises. At the beginning of June, US reconnaissance planes invaded China's northeast and Shandong, collecting intelligence on air strike targets. On January 20, 1953, President Eisenhow, who had just entered the White House, once again threatened China with a nuclear threat, claiming to end the war and to expand the war and use nuclear weapons. On February 11, 1953, the United States began planning to use tactical nuclear weapons in the Kaesong region of North Korea. Eventually it was not implemented due to the end of the Korean War."

On the first day of the transfer of prisoners of war to the neutral zone, the anti-communist prisoners, in the presence of Lieutenant General Timiah, the chairman of the Indian National Repatriation Commission, almost killed two prisoners who sought repatriation from the Indian army. Timaya, who was completely shocked, realized that these prisoners of war would be able to prevent anyone from repatriating during the interpretation period with harsh discipline. The anti-Communist prisoners of war strictly controlled the vast majority of prisoners of war through violent terror and successfully resisted the interpretation work. North Korea and China did not officially begin the interpretation of prisoners of war until October 10. At the end of the 90-day interpretation period on December 23, 1953, only 10 days were used for explanation. Of the more than 22,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, only 3,166 were explained, and only 136 of the 3,166 were required to repatriate, but in the same period hundreds of prisoners risked their lives to escape from the camp and demand repatriation. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission therefore believes that \"prisoners of war are This abnormal way of expressing desires makes people naturally suspect that all prisoners of war are not free individuals.\" The anti-communist prisoners of war directly obtained instructions from the South Korean and Taiwanese governments, and they used the most extreme violence.\" Eliminate evil spirits and prevent the return of prisoners of war. During the Indian military custody, a total of 38 prisoners of war died, most of whom were killed by anti-communist prisoners because of suspected repatriation tendencies, the most famous of which was the murder of Zhang Zilong. According to the repatriated prisoners of war, the anti-communist prisoners dug out the heart of Zhang Zilong to intimidate the prisoners of war who wish to return. The American journalist strongly denied the incident and called it the smear of the Communist Party. After the expiration of the interpretation period, the Neutral National Committee provided two opportunities for the prisoners to get rid of the anti-communist leader's control: on December 31, 1953, the Indian army \"named\" the prisoners of war, and 131 prisoners took the opportunity to repatriate; January 20, 1954 On the 21st, when the Indian army handed over prisoners of war to the US military, another 104 prisoners of war seized the last chance to escape the control of the prisoners. In its report, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission considered that prisoners of war who did not seek repatriation were not all voluntary, but because they were controlled by the fear of long-term indoctrination in prison camps. Timiah said that if there is an opportunity, there will undoubtedly be more prisoners of war to ask for repatriation. Those prisoners of war who demanded repatriation were not accidentally labeled by the propaganda agencies of the United States and Taiwan."

After the end of the Second World War, the south and north of the Korean Peninsula were occupied by the United States and the Soviet Union. The South was in the midst of US military and political affairs, and mass massacres for political opposition had begun. For example, in the Nanyuan massacre committed by the US military, thousands of people were massacred in October 1946. In April 1948, the uprising initiated by the South Korean Workers’ Party in Jeju Island was suppressed by the southern military and police. The Korean national army’s massacre throughout the island continued until the end of the Korean War. The US military was also involved, and at least 30,000 innocent civilians were killed. .

The blind air bombardment and machine gun fire by the US military in South Korea caused massive deaths of civilians. Jin Rongfan believes that although some bombings may be misjudged, according to later publicly available information, some bombings were intentional because they were found to be lurking among the people.

Members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said that over the past two years since its establishment, the Commission has received clues from hundreds of people requesting an investigation into more than 200 massacres of civilians produced by the US military between 1950 and 1951. The \"Truth and Reconciliation Commission\" of South Korea lasted for two and a half years. Based on the declassified archives and witnesses, the first round of investigations into the massacre of innocent civilians in the early days of the Korean War was completed, and the historical truth was uncovered.

The Additional Protocol to the 1977 Geneva Conventions for the first time explicitly prohibited massive bombing of civilians. The US military bombarded large-scale air forces and naval shelling in North Korea. According to North Korea’s incomplete statistics, as of May 1952, 18,000 children under the age of 14 died in the bombing of United Nations forces. In the summer of 1952, in order to force China and North Korea to surrender, the US military launched the largest air strike since the outbreak of the Korean War on July 11. In addition to military facilities, cities and villages also became targets of bombing. On July 11, the United Nations forces dispatched 1200 sorties of fighter-bombers and 52 B-29 bombers to bomb Pyongyang. Pyongyang Radio said that 1,500 buildings were destroyed and more than 6,000 residents were killed or injured. By mid-August, the ongoing bombing had caused more than 10,000 Pyongyang civilians to die. On August 29th, the United Nations forces launched a larger bombing of Pyongyang and dispatched 1,403 aircraft. In addition to Pyongyang, the other 77 North Korean cities were also bombed. The North Korean side said: \"From Pyongyang to the countryside, all the towns have become ruins.\" \"Anything that can be destroyed is gone.\" \"The number of casualties per day is greater than the number of repatriations in dispute.\" The governments of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union have repeatedly condemned the US military’s bombing of innocent civilians in North Korea, calling it \"crimes that violate international law and human morality.\" China and North Korea have accused the US military of carrying out a bacteriological war on the border between the two countries, saying that the bacteriological war has caused a large number of civilians to die. Chinese and foreign historians have different views on whether the germ warfare is true. The United States has completely denied allegations of bacterial warfare. Proposals by position-neutral organizations such as the International Red Cross or the World Health Organization were repeatedly rejected by the Soviet Union in the UN Security Council. The \"International Scientific Committee\" organized by the pro-Communist \"World Peace Council\" entered the report of the North Korean and Chinese investigations, and found that the US military used bacterial weapons in North Korea."

In the case of the Soviet Union boycotting the United Nations on behalf of the Chinese representative, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 112 and decided to be supervised by the UN Interim Committee of the United States to hold elections in the US-Soviet jurisdiction.

Since the 1990s, due to the economic difficulties of the DPRK, there has been a tendency for the North to escape from the South to surpass the South. Those who fled from North Korea to South Korea or elsewhere are also known as \"Northerners.\" Since the end of the Korean War in the early 1950s, more than 9,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea. At the beginning of 2007, this number exceeded 10,000. A spokesperson for the Korean Ministry of Unification said that since the 1990s, the number of fleeing refugees has increased in large numbers. From 2002 to 2006, 7,000 North Koreans fled to South Korea. Many Koreans first sneaked into China or Russia and then transferred to South Korea or other countries. Although the United States did not achieve the goal of South Korea's reunification, it reached the goal of defending Japan and promoting NATO cooperation. The Korean War encouraged the United States to adopt a cold war containment policy to pave the way for the United States to further expand the Asian defense circle. These Cold War policies ultimately led to the United States attempting to prevent Vietnam from falling into the hands of communism. The war has also complicated the relationship between the United States and China. Five-star Admiral Bradley, who served as chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Korean War, said that if MacArthur’s strategic plan was to extend the war in North Korea to bombing northeast China and blocking the Chinese coast, it would be at the wrong time. Wrong war with the wrong place, and the wrong enemy. In 1995, Washington, DC established the Korean War Memorial. The Americans who have experienced the baptism of the Vietnam War have almost forgotten this war. Therefore, the Korean War is also known as the \"forgotten war.\""

He believed that the final winner of this war was the United Nations Army: \"The war was not a tie, but South Korea won. When 5000 When the South Koreans live in freedom, strength and democracy and one of the world's most prosperous economies, North Korea's backwardness, repression and poverty are in sharp contrast and strong contrast. This is victory, which is the legacy of the predecessors.\" In addition, the war promoted national integration within the US military. More than 100,000 black soldiers joined the army to fight on the Korean peninsula. This is the first time that the US military has mixed black and white soldiers in the same unit on a large scale. The United States still has 28,000 soldiers in South Korea. The impact of war on the Soviet Union is very complicated. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union is the biggest winner. Stalin, the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, succeeded in forcing China to send troops to fight against the United States and other allied forces. It also sold a large amount of surplus military equipment from World War II to earn money and materials. China did not pay off all its arrears until 1965. China After the war, officials complained in English that the Soviet Union was a \"death dealer\" and sold a large number of inferior guns and ammunition to China during the Korean War. For the entire Cold War pattern, the Soviet Union succeeded in attracting the attention of the United States. To the Far East, the US military presence in Europe has declined relatively. At the same time, the United States has been mired in war and its economic strength has been reduced, providing an opportunity for the Soviet Union to achieve an \"equal ride\" between the two countries."

With the development of history, the Chinese people's feelings about this war have become more and more complicated.

In fact, after the end of the Korean War, the relationship between the two sides began to decline and eventually deteriorated. From October 2006 to January 2016, North Korea ignored China’s core interests and feelings. In spite of the strong opposition of China and the international community, it conducted four nuclear tests and repeatedly violated China’s denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Put China in an awkward position. This situation has not only not improved after Kim Jong-un succeeded to the throne, but has become increasingly fierce. Chinese officials have expressed public dissatisfaction, and the debate between academics and the public has become more intense."

They question whether China has paid a heavy price, lost the opportunity for unity, sacrificed economic development, and whether it is worthwhile to consolidate the Kim regime in North Korea. It is still in China's interest to maintain friendly relations with North Korea when North Korean leaders repeatedly stir up the situation in Northeast Asia. Of course, there are also some people who oppose \"abandoning the theory of the DPRK.\" They think that now \"abandoning the DPRK\" is a waste of 180,000 people. The importance of China's strategic position established through the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and its enormous international influence, including deep The influence implanted in the hearts of the North Korean people is immeasurable. Professors of South and North Korea and Professor Li Dunqi of Zhejiang University wrote in the Global Times several times that \"some strategic scholars have suggested that China abandon North Korea, and the problem is extremely serious.\" \"North Korea is a socialist political system, and it is difficult to replace China's geopolitical choices.\" In May 2017, the People’s Daily’s overseas version of the account, Knight Island, said that because Kim Il Sung wanted to unify the peninsula, the war broke out on the peninsula. China has paid the price of hundreds of thousands of lives, which has led to a 20-year confrontation between China and the United States. China has assumed most of the cost of North Korea’s \"willfulness\" and incitement. In addition, Ross Trier in his book \"The Biography of Mao Zedong\" believes that the Korean War \"disrupted the order of class struggle and economic construction\"; Shen Zhihua, an expert on cold war history, also pointed out that \"China is finally firmly tied to it. The Cold War chariot, which was originally centered on the US-Soviet confrontation, even fell deeper into the whirlpool of rivalry with the United States than the Soviet Union because of Mao’s revolutionary impulse that was provoked by the war.\""

The United States therefore protected Taiwan and the CCP lost the opportunity to seize Taiwan. The CCP’s participation in the war directly led to the breakdown of Sino-US relations. Since then, China has been isolated for a long time. The United States also recognizes the strategic importance of the Republic of China for pinning the People’s Republic of China and reintegrating Taiwan into the defensive system. The \"China-US Joint Defense Treaty\" signed in the future is based on the influence of the Korean War. The United States has thus changed its attitude towards the government of the Republic of China, and continues to recognize the Government of the Republic of China as the only legitimate Chinese government and to support the Republic of China’s seat in the United Nations. US President Truman dispatched the Seventh Fleet to patrol the Taiwan Strait in case the Chinese People's Liberation Army took the initiative to cross the sea to attack Taiwan, or the Chinese National Army attacked mainland China. During the Korean War, Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly proposed to send Taiwan troops to the Korean Peninsula to participate in the war and obtain support from MacArthur. However, it was opposed by the United Nations, the United States and South Korea’s Lee Seung-soo, but Taiwan still has material assistance, and Taiwan has also gained beauty because of the Korean War. Aid, the prisoners of war of the Chinese People’s Volunteers encouraged Taiwan’s morale after choosing Taiwan in their repatriation destination. A dignitary in Taiwan whispered that the Korean War was the Kuomintang’s Xi’an Incident, meaning that the Xi’an incident saved the Communist Party and the Korean War saved the Kuomintang."

The commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces in Japan also suspended the plan to dismantle the Japanese chaebol.

Externally, London’s fear of hostility with China would endanger Britain’s interests in China and even cause the Communist camp to pose a threat to the Far East colonies such as Hong Kong. Internally, Britain, which was badly wounded after World War II, slammed the national treasury due to armed policies and military spending, and shocked people’s livelihood. And social welfare budget. In the case of South Korean President Lee Seung-won publicly accused the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia and other major British co-sponsors of the \"influence of MacArthur was dismissed\", after the British people's corruption and authoritarianism of Lee's and South Korea's first republican regime Greatly resentful, the public opinion position has gradually turned to anti-war. The Korean War policy of the Labour Party and Attlee Cabinet lost the hearts of the people. The party also broke down due to pressure from public opinion and budget issues. These factors caused the Labor Party to lose in the 1951 Congressional election. The Conservative Party, which was dragged into the muddy battle of the Korean War before the election, won the ruling power under the leadership of Churchill. After Churchill took office, he quickly changed his position and promoted the armistice policy, which enabled the United Kingdom to withdraw from the problems of the Korean Peninsula and no longer support the United States on the Korean War. After the war, Britain was the last member of the United Nations to form a monument in the capital. The London Korean War Memorial was laid in November 2013 and was unveiled on December 3, 2014."

          "trans_context": "In 1948, the South and North of the Korean peninsula each established political power and independent troops. The North called the \"Korean People's Army\" and the South called the \"Republic of Korea.\" The latter was formed by the merger of the South Korean National Defense Guard and the Coast Guard during the US military and political period, with a total of eight divisions. In the spring of 1950, the total strength was 98,000. The Korean National Army was greatly affected by the old Japanese army. The core generals were mainly graduated from the Japanese Army Sergeant School, except for the Manchurian National Army. Most of the sergeants used to be soldiers in the Japanese army. In addition to serving in the Japanese army, the soldiers also had The police of the original Japanese rule. Only a few officers and men came from the Korean Reconstruction Army and even the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China. At the end of 1948 and June 1949, after the Soviet-US occupation forces withdrew, the contradictions surrounding the reunification between the South and the North became increasingly intensified. They attacked each other's borders with small units, and small-scale battles often occurred near the dividing line. Since Li Chengyin claimed to be going north to unify the Korean peninsula, the United States strictly restricted the types of aid to South Korea. The Korean National Army is equipped with 500 US military advisers. The weapons are only equipped with light weapons and light artillery, and there are no heavy equipment such as aircraft and tanks. The United States hopes that the Korean National Army will be able to withstand attacks from the North, but limit its ability to take the initiative to attack the North. South Korea’s military forces were established in 1946. In contrast, the Korean People’s Army, which was established with the help of the Soviet Union since 1946 and was established in February 1948, has thousands of Soviet-trained officers and modern weapons provided by the Soviet Union. Equipment, each division is equipped with 15 Soviet consultants. By June 1949, the infantry of the North Korean People’s Army had three divisions and one brigade. In April 1949, Soviet intelligence believed that South Korea was preparing for the Northern Expedition in June after the US military was withdrawn in May. While giving North Korea military assistance, Stalin suggested that North Korea seek support from the CCP for its military support. North Korea asked the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to let the Chinese people living in China, the Chinese people living in China, return to China and get the consent of Mao Zedong, chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. From July 1949 to August 1950, nearly 50,000 Korean troops serving in the People's Liberation Army returned to North Korea to join the People's Army. In the spring of 1950, on the eve of the war, the Korean People’s Army was about 135,000 people, equipped with Soviet-made T34 tanks and heavy artillery. Before the outbreak of the June war, North Korea’s total strength was expanded to 10 divisions, 1 tank brigade, 1 motorcycle regiment, 1 artillery regiment and 1 artillery regiment, totaling 175,000. The core strength of the People’s Army is the officers and men returning from the Soviet Union and China. The Japanese army and the Manchurian army have very few military origins."

          "trans_context": "The issue of withdrawal was actually raised before the negotiations began in July 1951. Originally, the Chinese side wanted to put the issue of withdrawal into the agenda of negotiations, but the United States resolutely opposed it. In order to stop the war as soon as possible, after consulting with Stalin, Mao Zedong agreed to leave the issue of withdrawal to be negotiated and resolved after the truce was achieved, without using it as a prerequisite for the truce. However, after the truce in July 1953, the high-level political meeting that was supposed to be held within three months was not held. At the 1954 Geneva Conference, the North Korean issue was also fruitless. Since 2000, Korean-themed works have been regarded as restricted areas in mainland China. In 1998, the two official media, the Bayi Film Studio and China Central Television, respectively filmed the film \"38 Degrees North\" and the TV series \"Anti-American Aid Korea\". Both works were not allowed to be broadcast. Since then, the production and broadcast of Chinese film and television dramas have formed taboos on this subject. Some think this is a decision made by the Chinese government to avoid stimulating the United States. According to Yang Weiguang, the former director of China Central Television, the TV series \"Anti-US Aid Korea\" was banned because the Chinese Foreign Ministry scruples the United States, but was not broadcast because of the September 11 incident. Until 2016, the TV series \"38th Line\" broke this political taboo. Zhao Nanqi, a former PLA general who was the translator of Peng Dehuai's North Korean translation, promoted the broadcast of the play. In the same year, the TV drama \"Minister Peng Dehuai\" broadcast by China Central Television also promoted by Zhao Nanqi, but only because of the Korean War, it still needs the highest level of approval."

Its annual budget is about $10 million, and its source is its web crawler service, partnerships, sponsorships, and the Cali-Austin Foundation. Headquartered in Richmond, San Francisco, there are only a handful of employees, most of whom work in book scanning centers and data centers in Redwood City. The database is a member of the International Internet Retention Association and was selected as the official designated library by the State of California in 2007. The information collected by the archives is varied. As of the beginning of 2015, the Internet Archive has included 2,400 classic games."

The west side of the state is Minnesota, the southwest is Iowa, the south is Illinois, the east is Lake Michigan, the northeast is the Upper Michigan Peninsula, and the north is Lake Superior. The area of Wisconsin is ranked 23rd in all states and the population is ranked 20th. The state government is located in Madison and the largest city is Milwaukee on the west coast of Lake Michigan. The US population estimate for 2012 shows that the state has a population of 5.726 million. The state name is derived from the transliteration of a French name in French, meaning \"the place we live.\" Wisconsin's English original name was adapted from an Indian foreign language in French. It may come from the European and Buwei language \"Misswa Xining\", meaning \"land of red stone\", which may also affect the name of the Wisconsin River. The name of Wisconsin was originally used only for the Wisconsin River. The river name is recorded in French. \"Osconsin\" means all over the grass and then changed to the English name today. After Wisconsin officially became a state, it refers to the entire state. In the current European and Buhweh language, \"Wild Star\" or \"Vasco Comet\" means \"the place where the mole is inhabited\" or \"the land of the little mole.\" Others say that the name of Wisconsin stems from the \"water gathering\" or \"boulder\"."

The northern part is the highlands of Superior, the south is the plain, and there are more than 10,000 lakes. In the Quaternary, except for the southwest, they were covered by glaciers, so most of them were glacial lakes. The temperate continental climate is cold in winter and hot in summer. It is regulated by the Great Lakes and the climate in the lakeside area is mild. The average annual precipitation is 760 mm, which is more in spring and summer. The forest coverage rate is 45%, mainly distributed in the north. There are two characteristics of the state: first, the state of the dairy cow. The state is full of wavy ground, growing grass, with more than two million cows. 80% of the statewide farms are farms that farm cattle. The milk, butter and cheese produced each year rank first in all states. Second, the state of plantation and papermaking. The terrain, climate, and soil of the state are suitable for reforestation. Through decades of efforts, a large amount of paper has been used."

It focuses on using some tools and methods to solve management problems, such as operational research, statistics, etc. to quantitative qualitative analysis. Management is defined as the process by which managers and others and through others can efficiently and effectively complete activities. In the past, management was mainly used in operational research to solve problems encountered in management. In the past ten years, management science has developed rapidly. It has not only used operational research to analyze some specific problems, but also used comprehensive cross-science in the two fields of natural sciences and social sciences to analyze such as operational management, human resource management, Risk management and uncertainty decision-making, evolution, emergence, adaptation, self-organization, and self-similar mechanism of complex systems. It is not already covered by an operations research institute. Since all organizations can be considered a certain system, management can also be seen as a phenomenon of human behavior, including designing and promoting better production of the system. This view creates opportunities for development for “management” itself, and is a prerequisite for managing yourself before managing others. Some people think that management should be classified into the natural sciences, while others believe that it should be classified into the social sciences."

          "trans_context": "Many organizations have three levels of management: grassroots, middle, and high-level. These managers form a hierarchy of powers and responsibilities and accomplish different tasks. In many organizations, the number of managers is pyramidal in shape relative to the level. Managers at each level have corresponding responsibilities and titles. Senior management includes the board of directors, president, vice president, chief executive, and other chief executives. They are responsible for controlling and supervising the entire company, setting the tone at the highest point, developing strategic plans, company policies, and determining the company's direction. In addition, top-level managers play a key role in raising external resources and are accountable to shareholders and the public. The board of directors usually consists of non-executive directors who have a fiduciary duty to shareholders but do not closely participate in the company's daily activities, which varies with the type, size and culture of the company. These directors are theoretically responsible for violating this obligation and usually they will insure director and officer liability insurance. It is estimated that the world's top 500 directors spend 4.4 hours a week fulfilling their board obligations, with a median salary of $212,512 in 2010. The board of directors identifies the company's strategy and makes major decisions, such as major acquisitions and the hiring, review, and dismissal of top management, while the CEO is usually responsible for hiring other positions. However, the board's participation in the appointment of other senior executive positions such as the Treasurer is also increasing. In 2013, a survey of more than 160 CEOs and directors from public and private companies found that the CEO's biggest weakness was “guidance skills” and “board participation,” and 10% of companies never evaluated executives. . The board may also employ some employees to report to them or directly hire independent contractors, for example, the board usually chooses the auditor's approach."

Thus, Henry Fayol believes that management has six major roles: forecasting, planning, organizing, leading, coordinating, and controlling."

The typical activity is to make money, create affordable, valuable products, and provide jobs for employees. In non-profit organizations, management maintains the will of donors. In most management or governance processes, shareholders elect the board of directors, who appoint management executives. A few organizations have even applied other ways to participate in the appointment of managers. In the public sector, management is mainly represented by representative democracy, and politicians receive public positions through elections. The history of management is difficult to trace. Some people start from the post-modern view and believe that management science does not exist before modernization, only the type. Other authors trace the development of management science from the Sumerians and the builders of the ancient Egyptian pyramids. The slave masters of that century faced the power of resistance at work, but many early industrial companies used their own powers so that they did not have to be forced to face the problem of systematization. But innovations such as the dissemination of Arabic numerals and the codification of double-entry bookkeeping provide tools for management estimation, planning and control. The Hebrew \"Moses and Five Classics\" records the rich laws and detailed regulations on various government affairs, human relations, and sacrifices. Before the industrial revolution, it was not surprising that the owners of the company themselves managed to take full responsibility for the limitations of commercial operations and the lack of mechanized recording equipment. But as organizations become larger and more complex, it becomes more common for industry owners to separate from day-to-day managers."

Some military military methods in ancient times provided reference materials for secular administrators. For example, in the 6th century BC, Chinese military general Sun Wu’s \"The Art of War\" emphasizes confiding oneself and knowing each other. In ancient times and in the Middle Ages, many people wrote books on \"The King's Mirror\" to teach the new king how to govern the country. For example, the \"Political Theory\" by Jotiliye of India, and the \"Monarchy\" by the Italian writer Nikolo Machiavelli. Classical economists such as Adam Smith and John Stewart Mill provided theoretical basis for resource allocation, production, and pricing strategies. At the same time, inventors such as Eli Whitney, James Watt, and Matthew Bolton developed production technology factors such as standardization, quality control, cost accounting, interchangeable parts, and production planning. Many of these management factors have been applied in the US economy that was slaved before 1861. At that time, there were 4 million people in the society. In the current terminology, it is the \"management\" of mass production. In 1776, Adam Smith wrote the famous \"The Wealth of Nations\", which mentioned the efficiency of organizational production through division of labor. Smith described how improvements in the process have improved pin productivity. At that time, a worker could produce 200 pins a day. Smith analyzed the production steps and carried out a division of 10 people, which increased the efficiency of producing pins in one day to 48,000."

Drucker later wrote 39 books, many of which still use the same idea. Dodge, Ronald Fisher, and Thornton Frye introduced statistical techniques for management research. In the 1940s, Patrick Blackett devoted himself to the development of applied mathematics in operations research, initially to implement military operations. Operations research is sometimes referred to as \"management science\", trying to use scientific methods to solve decision problems, and can be directly applied to multiple management problems, especially in logistics and operations. With the widespread recognition of managers in the 20th century as a class, practitioners who have emerged in the management of art/science have begun to have some prestige, thus opening the way for a more popular management mindset to sell to the public. In this context, many fashion theories of management are more related to popular psychology than to scientific theories of management. Recent developments include limitations theory, goal management, reengineering, Six Sigma and various information technology driven theories such as agile software development and team management theory."

          "trans_context": "Observers in the 21st century have found it increasingly difficult to further differentiate management teams based on functionality. More and more processes require several functional items at the same time. Therefore, people are more inclined to think about management according to different processes, tasks, and goals. The branch theory of management is also applied to non-profit organizations and governments: public management, public administration, education management, etc. Management further extends to civil society, such as non-profit organization management, public welfare entrepreneurship, and so on. It is worth noting that many of the assumptions in management science have been attacked, such as criticism from business ethics, critical management research, anti-corporate radical movements, and so on. One of the results is that the democratization of labor has become more common, and in some places it has spread across all levels of management. However, these patterns are produced before all political forms, and some form naturally, even before the command level. All management receives some form of democracy to varying degrees – in fact, in the long run, management must be supported by the majority of employees to function. Otherwise, employees either leave to find other jobs, or organize strikes and protests. Although the management trend is towards democracy, the command-control structure is still in fact organized. An example of this deep-rooted command-control structure is that the recent massive layoffs have had little impact on management. In some cases, management adds bonuses to employees when they cut off grassroots employees. According to Leadership Scholar Manfred Katz, all senior management teams are inevitably affected by a certain degree of personality disorder."

It is based on the natural will of people, and people's relationships are based on habits, traditions and religions. The relationship between blood, neighborhood and friends is the main link of the community. The purpose and means of communication are the same here. The traditional rural village is the representative of the community. Community control refers to the ability of residents living in the community to influence public facilities to serve the community. After the 21st century, the People’s Republic of China, in most places except Shanghai, successively merged the residents’ committees and added the word “community” to their names. The purpose of this move is to transform the functions of the residents committees that have been too strong in administrative management to make them more inclined to community services.

          "trans_context": "At present, there are three main views on Hakka origin: the orthodox Han people said: Hakka history historian Luo Xianglin published the book \"Introduction to Hakka Studies\" in 1933, arguing that the Hakka family is a descendant of ancient Central Plains immigrants, and has nothing to do with the indigenous peoples of the South. After many wars, he gradually moved from northern China to the south, and was the purest Han Chinese. The Han people said that the Hakkas were from the end of the Qin Dynasty to the beginning of the Song Dynasty. The Han people in the Yellow River Basin moved several times from the Central Plains to the junction of Guangdong, Fujian and Guizhou. They were merged with the ethnic minorities' blood and cultural exchanges. The result is a relatively stable Hakka family. Li Hui et al. published a genetic analysis of the Changting Hakkas in Fujian in 2003, showing that the local patriarchal structure is about 80.2% of the Han people in the Central Plains, about 13% of the Yi people, and about 6.8% of the Yi people, which is different from other Yi people. The southern Han nationality; the maternal system is quite different from the northern Han nationality, and basically the same as the Yi nationality. The paper also mentioned: \"Changting is the central area of the Hakka people, so the Han nationality must be relatively high. The proportion of Han nationality in the Hakkas in remote areas cannot be guaranteed to be as high.\" The book \"The Hakka Sources Exploring the Olympics\" by Professor Jia Xuejia of Meizhou Jiaying College in Guangdong Province is the main argument. Through the discussion of the humanities in the historical period of the Hakka area and the comparative study of the Hakka culture in the Hakka culture and the history, the author believes that the Hakka people who lived in the Fujian-Guangdong side for a long time are the Central Plains people who moved to the south and the Fujian, Guangdong and Fujian. The community produced by the ancient Yue ethnic relics in the triangle region is mainly the ancient Yue people living on this land, not a few Central Plains people living in this area. In 1991, Zhao Tongmao and others published the isoform distribution of immunoglobulins in 24 ethnic groups and 74 groups in China. It was found that the frequency of two haplotypes was very different between southerners and northerners. The frequency of Luoyang in Henan was 28.26%. &39.35%, Henan Shangqiu 24.04% & 35.48%, while Meixian is 71.71% & 11.76%, Zhejiang Jingning Dais 75.44% & 11.06%, Guangxi Nanning Zhuang 77.19% & 3.62%, showing Meixian people in Physically different from the northerners, and close to the southern minorities."

The area was called \"Hakka Village\". Before the British colonization of Hong Kong, there were as many as 128 Hakka villages in 336 villages in Hong Kong. In 2010, there were about 1 million Hakkas in Hong Kong, including Hakkas and \"non-indigenous\" Hakkas. Hakkas' footprints are visible in villages in Tai Po, North District, Sha Tin, Sai Kung, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. The number of Hakkas in Hong Kong is quite large. However, due to the impact of the replacement of the standard Cantonese, the Hakka language is no longer dominant in Hong Kong. Many Hakkas will not speak Hakka, or just understand."

The end of the war in the late Eastern Han Dynasty made the population decline sharply and the economy was seriously damaged. Therefore, all three countries attach importance to economic development, and the demand brought by war has made many advances in various technologies. At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Han Ting authorized the local chaos due to the chaos of the Yellow Turban, which made the local forces rise. Dong Zhuo’s chaos and the confrontation with the forces of the Kanto moved to Chang’an, which caused the imperial power of the court to be lost. Among them, Cao Cao supported Han Xiandi who fled back to Luoyang and moved to Xuchang. He defeated many forces and finally defeated Yuan Shao, the biggest force in the north, in the battle of Guandu in 200 years, and roughly controlled the northern part of China. Cao Cao used the superior force to levy Jingzhou in the south, but in the winter of 208, the battle of Chibi was defeated by Sun Quan and Liu Bei, and formed the prototype of the Three Kingdoms. In 220 years, Cao Cao died of illness. His son Cao Yu forced the Han Emperor to make the emperor, and the country was called \"Wei\". The history was called Cao Wei. So far, the Eastern Han Dynasty was destroyed and officially entered the Three Kingdoms period. In the next year, Liu Bei, who is mainly based in Yizhou, also known as the Emperor of the Han Dynasty. The country continued to be \"Han\" and the history was called Shuhan."

          "trans_context": "The political system of the Three Kingdoms period was slightly different from that of the Eastern Han Dynasty. The reform of Cao Wei was more, and most of the Western Jin Dynasty later inherited its system. Cao Cao was able to grasp the power because the imperial power was concentrated in Shangshutai. In order to avoid the excessive power of Shangshutai, Wei Wendi Cao Yu officially separated the Chinese book supervisor, and the political system began to move toward the three provinces and six systems. In addition, a new mobile library is also set up, called the platform system. Some officials from Shangshutai were assigned to work with the emperor. In terms of the local system, there is a metropolitan system similar to that of the commander of the military region. Among them, \"the military and the foreign military of the governor\" have mastered the central military and political powers, and Sima III has mastered the Cao Wei court in this position. Sun Wu also has a Chinese book order and the governors of the Chinese and foreign military. All three countries have supervisory organs similar to Yushitai. Sun Wu took the political affairs of the prime minister and was a permanent official with the right to participate in politics. When Sun Liang was in the throne, he was young, and the ancestors were controlled by the ancestors Sun Jun and Sun Wei, and the king was abolished. The military power is the military administration of the Sima Sima, the generals and the generals of the Shangda are the supreme military commanders, and the military commanders of the Chinese and foreign military are particularly heavy. Its policy of governing the country is mainly based on the restrictions of self-protection and Shide, and the political system is roughly similar to the Eastern Han Dynasty. The regime was supported by the Jiangbei family of Zhangbei, Zhou Yu and Lu Su, who lived in Nandu, and the Wu family, who lived in Jiangnan, and the relatives of Lu Xun and Lu Kangfu. In the agricultural sector, there is a system of reinstating to exempt some of the tenants' classes. In fact, the burden on the landlord is relieved, and there is no first class in the Western Jin Dynasty. Although Sun Quan built water conservancy with the help of Gu Yu, Jiangnan was developed. However, Sun Quan did not handle the matter of the heir, which made the political situation later unstable. After Sun Quan’s death, Chaozheng was later held hostage by Sun Jun and Sun Wei. After the death of Wu Jingdi Sun Hugh, the Minister believed that the Prince was young and the younger Sun Yan was the emperor. But he was a cruel and good-looking monarch, which led to the death of Sun Wu."

          "trans_context": "In view of the malpractice of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cao Cao did not emphasize the virtues of the people, opposed the \"Party and the Zhou\", adopted the \"only talent is the way\", and successively proposed three orders for honour. Cao Cao is a man who is expensive, and he is allowed to use his intelligence. The magic is used in politics. He has greatly improved his political situation in the end of the Han Dynasty. In 220 years, Cao Wei was established. The son of Cao Cao, Wei Wendi Cao Yu accepted the proposal of Chen Qun and other nine products to be selected as talents to replace the Han Dynasty's inspection system. The main content of the system is to appoint local sergeants as local officials in the locality, and the local officials assess local people by family, morality and talent. The results assessed according to these criteria will be presented to the central government as the basis for awarding talents. This system, because it depends entirely on the preferences or interests of the Zhongzheng official, almost completely monopolizes the official position of the family. This laid the foundation for the Western Jin Dynasty's clan politics and formed a situation in which \"the top grade has no cold door and the next product has no family\" until the Sui Dynasty was replaced by the imperial examination system. The talents of the Caowei Group can be divided into several parts. The core members are Cao's Xiahou clan forces, such as Cao Ren, Cao Hong, Xia Houyi, Xia Houyuan and so on. The second part is a large number of social celebrities in the late Han Dynasty, such as 荀彧, 荀攸, 钟繇, Chen Qun, Sima Yi, Hua Wei, Wang Lang, etc. Some of these talents are aimed at calming down the Han Room, and the other part is assisting Cao Room Han Liguo. The third part is the members of the Liu royal family, such as Liu Wei, Liu Fang, Liu Wei, etc., most of them give up their orthodox burdens and support the Wei room. The last part is also the largest number. Regardless of the origin or the enemy, as long as there is a talented person, Cao Cao will reuse it, such as ban, Lejin, Zhangliao, Pound and so on. The Caowei Group finally formed two political factions, namely, the Yingying Group, which was born of the world-aged group, and the Qipei Group, which was dominated by Cao's Xiahou, and supported the support during the Cao Cao period. However, the dispute over inheritance made Cao Cao's eldest son Cao Yu and Yu Ying Group have a good relationship. Among them, Chen Qun, Sima Yi, Wu Zhi and Zhu Xi had the best relationship, which was collectively called four friends, and finally weakened the power of the Pei Pei Group."

Zhuge Liang believes that Jiangdong cannot compete with the Central Plains alone, and Sun Quan will not succumb to Cao Cao. He believes that Sun and Liu Ding must be alliances against Cao. Zhou Yu also believes that although there are many Cao Jun, the soldiers are suspicious and do not need to be afraid. Finally, the Sun Liu Alliance defeated Cao Cao in the Battle of Chibi. Destruction stage: After Liu Bei occupied Jing and Yi Erzhou, Sun Quan Yu Guanyu went to Xiangfan on the occasion of the Northern Expedition, and sent Lu Meng to Jingzhou, and the Sun Liu Alliance broke down. Later, Cao Yu called the emperor, and Sun Quan even wanted to become a genus of Cao Wei, and was named Wu Wang.

Cao Yu was here to use his excuse to send troops to the three roads to levy Sun Quan, but they were all resisted by Sun Quan along the Yangtze River. Finally, the maintenance stage: After Liu Bei’s death, Zhuge Liang immediately sent Deng Zhidong to rebuild with Sun Quan. After Sun Quan listened to Deng Zhi’s words, he self-destructed Cao Wei, united with Shu Han, and sent Zhang Wen and Shu Han. After that, Zhuge Liang sent Fei, Chen Zhen and Wu Tong.

Cao Cao feared that Liu prepared to take Wudu to force Guanzhong, but moved more than 50,000 of his people to Fufeng and Tianshui counties. In Cao Weichu, there were also Wudu cadres attached to the migration. At that time, there were Shanshan, Gaochang, Yi, Kucha and Yuxi in the Western Region. Wei Wendi sent officials to manage the Western Region and strengthen ties with the countries in the Western Region. However, the influence was not significant. In 229, Wei Wendi also changed the Da Yueshi Wang Bo to be the pro-Wei Da Yue Shi Wang.

In the war zone, the governor system can add \"the governor of the Zhuzhou military\", and its military and political affairs and one, more than the state and county. For example, Cao Wei has a desolation governor and a governor of Yangzhou. Shuhan has the Governor of Hanzhong, the Governor of Yong'an and the Governor of Yanjiang. Sun Wu also set up the governor in Xiling, Jiangling, Baqiu, Jiaozhou and Guangzhou. In the Han Dynasty, the ministry was the name of the military, and later referred to the army of private command. In the late Eastern Han Dynasty, many war-torn peasants went to ask the armed people to protect themselves. The name of the family is to gather the peasants for self-protection. When the enemy invades, they fight for the trilogy. In normal times, they are engaged in production. Later, it developed into a private army. Among them, Sun Wu implemented the hereditary system of military discipline, and legalized the generals to establish the affiliation relationship with the soldiers for generations. In terms of the characteristics of the three countries' military, Wei Jun is mainly divided into the army, the cavalry and the water army. In addition, there are elite troops such as the tiger leopard rider and the blackbird cavalry. But the horses at that time were few and precious. In the early stage, the soldiers relied on the recruitment, collection and forced capture of prisoners and ethnic minorities as soldiers. In the later period, the world military system gradually formed and became the main form of military gathering. In order to stabilize the military resources, Cao Wei implemented strict separation of military and civilian households. Except for his sons and generations, the military and female wives and daughters only married military units to ensure their reproduction."

Shuhan also has ethnic minority units, mainly including squadrons, sergeants, and Qing dynasty soldiers. Among them, the \"No Flying Army\" is the most famous. In terms of weapons and equipment, the Han Han has developed more than the Qin and Han Dynasties. In terms of military sources, Shuhan implemented the military system.

From the late Eastern Han Dynasty to the Western Jin Dynasty unified the country, although the time is separated by 125 years, the population is only 35.3% of the peak population of the Eastern Han Dynasty. At this point, the account was despised, and it was gradually recovered when Emperor Wendi was in office. It is also worth noting that the population is highly militarized. At that time, the population controlled by the three countries included warships, tenants, and Putian households. For example, Cao Cao implemented the Putian system as early as the creation period. Although the population of Shuhan is only 900,000, it has more than 100,000 troops, accounting for one tenth of the total population.

          "trans_context": "At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, because of the scourge of natural disasters and the destruction of society, the economy was in recession and a large number of agricultural land was abandoned. Some of the tyrannical families have led the tribes and established the Fortress to defend themselves. After engaging in production activities around it, it gradually became a self-sufficient estate system. Both the dock and the manor system influenced the economic model of the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties. Due to the collapse of the Eastern Han court, no one recasts the worn copper coins, and a large amount of private money appeared. After the trip to the three countries, the newly issued copper coins were not widely available, and they had to officially use the physical objects such as the cloth and the valley as the main currencies. Among the three kingdoms of Cao Wei, Shu Han and Sun Wu, Cao Wei had the largest population and the largest area of land reclamation. This was the reason why Cao Wei was the strongest in the three countries. Cao Wei promoted the Putian system and organized the peasants to cultivate the Guantian. This will slightly restore social order and strengthen the strength of Cao Wei. Another demonstration of Cao Wei's emphasis on agriculture is its great water conservancy, and the scale and quantity of its projects are second to none in the three countries. For example, in the Guanzhong area, the construction of the channel and the construction of the reservoir have transformed more than 3,000 salt-alkali land in one fell swoop, and the treasury has been greatly enriched. Another example is Cao Wei's water conservancy project in Henan, which has doubled the grain output. However, the \"Three Kingdoms Food and Drugs\" also pointed out that many of these water conservancy projects lack planning and can only receive short-term effects. Cao Wei built a large-scale official handicraft workshop to develop handicraft production. Trade cities such as Handan and Luoyang have developed commercial economy and trade with overseas. In addition, the shipbuilding industry, ceramics industry, silk industry, salt industry, etc. are also very developed. It is worth noting that Cao Wei has been unable to get rid of the economic model of physical transactions. A few attempts to reform the currency have ended in failure, which may be related to the lack of large-scale copper mines in the country."

Because of the hypocrisy of the name, it is natural and straightforward, and it belongs to Lao Zhuang. Due to political corruption in the late Eastern Han Dynasty, the situation was chaotic. Cao Cao and Zhu Geliang used the ideas of famous or legalists to restore social order. Cao Cao advocated that rewards must be punished and advocated the rule of law. Put forward the concept of \"employing talents\" to break the standard of the first or the famous. Zhuge Liang also advocated the concept of the rule of law. After entering the country, he revised the legal system and enforced the law fairly. It is suggested that the idea of \"governing the country and doing things in the right place\" should be applied. He also attaches importance to the military law. For example, the battle of the street pavilion was violated by the military commander and he was also blamed. The famous thoughts of the late Han and Wei Dynasties provided the basis for the post-Wei and Jin dynasties of the Wei and Jin Dynasties, which enabled the famous scholars to turn the focus from the specific questions of the famous law to the abstract speculation of metaphysics based on the political darkness. In terms of classics, Zheng Xuan’s classics in the late Han Dynasty have been highly praised. However, in the Wei and Jin Dynasties, Wang Su succeeded his father and studied it. His views on the classics were different from those of Zheng Xuan. After the Wei and Wei Dynasties in the Western Jin Dynasty, Emperor Sima Yan of Jinwu was the grandson of Wang Su, Wang Xuexuan was established as the official school, and Zheng Shen Wang, Wang Xue became the master of the time. However, Confucian classics has been trapped in the rigid situation of the study of chapters and sentences, and increasingly unable to adapt to the needs of reality.

He and Dong Feng and Zhang Zhongjing were called \"Jian'an Sanshen Medicine\" by the history book. Hua Tuo may be the first medical practitioner to use the anesthetic \"Ma Bo San\" for surgery. In view of the frequent turmoil in the contemporary era, the epidemic is prevalent, and the disease is devoted to the study of diseases. According to various books, the book \"Treatise on Febrile Diseases\" is mentioned. One of the pretexts in the book mentions that one of the motivations for taking medicine is that more than half of the people in the family die. In the case of typhoid and other diseases. This book is a collection of the two doctors of the Han Dynasty and the Dacheng of the two parties. It is the first classic in the history of Chinese medicine. Yu Jiayan called this book: \"For the ancestors of the public, the ancestors of the group.\" Later generations regarded it as \"medical saint.\" Huangfu was poor from childhood, studying sleepless nights, and was less than fame and fortune. He conducted in-depth research on acupuncture, and organized various meridian theories and acupuncture methods before the Jin Dynasty into acupuncture and moxibustion, which became the model of acupuncture and moxibustion. He also has \"The Theory of Cold Food\", and the popularity of cold food after the Wei and Jin Dynasties gradually became popular. Regarding other technologies, in astronomy, Chen Zhu has served as Sun Wu and the Western Jin Dynasty Tai Shiling. He collects information from various factions, perfects the Chinese star official system, and draws star maps for future generations. Yan Xiu's \"Cartography Six Body\" occupies an important position in the history of Chinese maps. Pu Yuan is good at exercising irons. He is a knife for Zhuge Liang in the valley. The knife can open the bamboo tube filled with iron beads, which is known as the sword. Because Sun Wu is located in the Jiangnan area, the waterway is developed and the shipbuilding technology is developed. Its warships have five floors, and some can accommodate three thousand soldiers. Shuhan produces well salt and uses local natural gas to boil salt, which increases production capacity."

Sun Ce, who supported Yuan Shao, attacked Guangling in Cao Cao in 200 years, but was defeated by Chen Deng. After Sun Ce was killed in April of the same year, Sun Quan, who succeeded to the throne, changed his mind with Cao Cao. Yuan Shao sees that Cao Cao has grown stronger and decided to lead the army to a decisive battle in the south. He has sent generals Yan Liang to attack Baima and Wenqiu to attack Yanjin, but they have been killed. Later, Yuan Shao personally led the troops and entered Yangwu, and Cao Cao also returned to the military official crossing, deep trench high base, the confrontation between the two armies for half a year. In the end, Cao Cao attacked the granary of Yuan Jun in the night of Wuchao’s war, and Yuan Junjun’s heart changed and collapsed. This battle became an important battle for Cao Cao to control the north. In 201, Yuan Shao also led the army to fight again in Cangting, and lost to Cao Jun, and finally died in the following year. Cao Cao took the opportunity to defeat Liu Bei in Weinan, and Liu Bei fled to Jingzhou to follow Liu. The third son Yuan Shang who inherited Yuan Shao’s territory and his long brother Qingzhou Yuan Tan were jealous in 203 years. Cao Cao took the opportunity to marry Yuan Tan and in the next year he captured Yuan Shang’s base. Yucheng became the main base of Cao Cao. Yuan Shang and his second brother Yuan Xi went to support the foreign family Wu Yi of Yuan Jia. In the following year, Cao Cao successively attacked Yuan Tan and Zhangzhou Gaogan. In 207, Cao Cao attacked Wusong with a light soldier. He led Zhang Liao to kill his leader, and the Yuan brothers fled to Gongsun Kang. Gong Sunkang killed Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi for fear of Cao Cao, and returned to Cao Cao. At this point, Cao Cao roughly controlled the Hebei and Central Plains areas, and prepared for the south."

Jingzhou Mu Liu watched his death at this time, and his second son, Liu Yin, who had not yet reached adulthood, immediately surrendered to Cao Cao. Liu Bei, who was attached to Liu Biao, immediately evacuated the resident Xinye and fled to Gangneung. Cao Jun, who was caught up in Dangyang on the way to escape, was defeated. He was then taken by Liu Zi’s eldest son Liu Qi to take the boat to Xiakou. Sun Quan sent a contact with Lu Su and Liu Bei, and Liu Bei also sent Zhuge Liang to Jiangdong. After discussion, the two sides decided to form an alliance against Cao. The Sun Liulian Army was established with a total of about 50,000. Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu were the deputy governors. At this time, Cao Cao led the Northern Army and the Jingzhou Army to claim 1 million, and the facts were about 150,000 to 230,000. The two sides confronted the Yangtze River in Wulin and Chibi. In the end, Zhou Yu used the terrain wind to cooperate with Liu Bei to defeat Cao Jun. Cao Cao returned to the north and served as Cao Ren Shou Jiangling.

          "trans_context": "Metabolism is a general term for chemical reactions in which organisms sustain life. These reactions enable organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structure, and respond to the environment. Metabolism is usually divided into two categories: catabolism can decompose large molecules to obtain energy; anabolism can use energy to synthesize various components in cells, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Metabolism is the process by which an organism continuously exchanges matter and energy. Once the exchange of matter and energy ceases, the life of the organism ends. Chemical reactions in metabolism can be grouped into metabolic pathways that convert one chemical to another through the action of a series of enzymes. Enzymes are very important for metabolic reactions because enzymes can drive another difficult reaction through a thermodynamically prone reaction, making it feasible; for example, using the energy produced by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate to drive other chemical reaction. The metabolic mechanism of an organism determines which substances are nutritious for this organism and which are toxic. For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, but this gas is fatal to animals. Metabolic rate, or metabolic rate, also affects the amount of food a organism needs."

In eukaryotes, this process is accomplished by a series of membrane proteins located on the mitochondrial membrane, known as the electron transport chain. In prokaryotes, the corresponding protein is located on the inner membrane of the cell. These proteins transport protons across the membrane using the energy generated by the reaction of electron-reductive molecules to oxygen. The result of pumping the protons out of the mitochondria creates a difference in the concentration of protons on both sides of the mitochondrial membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient on both sides of the membrane. The driving force generated by the electrochemical gradient causes the protons to re-enter the mitochondria through the adenosine triphosphate synthase on the mitochondrial membrane. Such a proton flow causes the subunit of adenosine triphosphate synthase to rotate, and further activates the active site on the synthase domain to deform and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate, ultimately producing adenosine triphosphate."

These processes are important for the overall biogeochemical cycle, such as acetic acid formation, as well as nitrification and denitrification, and are critical to soil fertility. The energy in sunlight can be captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green bacteria and some native organisms. This process of acquiring light energy is often coupled with the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic matter and becomes part of photosynthesis. Light energy acquisition and carbon fixation systems can operate separately in prokaryotes because purple and green bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy, whether in carbon fixation or in the hydrolysis of organic matter."

In addition, the photosystem is a protein complex that plays a major role in photosynthesis, including photosystems 1 and 2. In plants, the light system 2 can use light energy to obtain electrons from water and release oxygen.

The ethyl hydrazide chain on the fatty acid is extended by a reaction cycle including the addition of an acetamyl group, reduction to ethanol, and continued reduction to an alkane. Enzymes that play a role in the biosynthesis of fatty acids can be divided into two categories: in animals and fungi, all fatty acid synthesis reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional enzyme; in plant plastids and bacteria, there are many differences. The enzyme catalyzes each reaction separately. Terpenes and isoprenes are a large family of lipids that make up the largest class of plant natural compounds. These compounds are polymerized and modified in units of isoprene; wherein isoprene is provided by a reactive precursor, isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These two precursors can be synthesized in different ways. Animals and archaea use the mevalonic acid pathway to produce these two compounds from the acetamidine coenzyme; plants and bacteria produce them by the pyrovaric acid pathway using pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate as the substrate. Another important response to the use of these activated isoprene donors is the biosynthesis of steroids. Among them, the isoprene units are joined together to form squalene, which is then folded up and subjected to a proton-induced continuous ring-forming reaction to obtain lanolinol. Lanolinol can continue to be converted to other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol."

Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all 20 amino acids, while mammals can only synthesize 10 non-essential amino acids.

All amino acids can be formed from intermediates in the glycolysis, citric acid cycle or pentose phosphate cycle. Among them, the nitrogen required for the synthesis process is provided by glutamic acid and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis requires the formation of an appropriate alpha-keto acid prior to formation of the amino acid by transamination. Nucleotides are synthesized from amino acids, carbon dioxide, and formic acid. Since the synthetic pathways require a large amount of metabolic energy, most organisms have an effective system for nucleotide remediation. It is synthesized on the basis of nucleosides. Adenine and guanine are derived from the precursor nucleoside molecule inosine monophosphate, while hypoxanthine is derived from the amino acids from glycine, glutamine and glutamine, and from the coenzyme tetrahydrogen leaf. The formic acid group transferred from the acid salt is synthesized. Pyrimidine is synthesized from the base orotate, and the orotate is converted from glutamine and glutamine."

Such similarities in metabolism are most likely due to the high efficiency of the relevant metabolic pathways and the formation of these pathways in the early stages of evolution. Most of the constituent structures of plants, animals and microorganisms are composed of three basic types of biomolecules, such as amino acids, sugars and lipids. Since these molecules are essential for life, metabolism both makes these molecules for use in building cells and tissues, and digests and decomposes these molecules in food after ingesting food to provide the energy needed to sustain life. Many important biochemical substances can be polymerized together to form multimers such as deoxyribonucleic acid and protein. These biomacromolecules are essential components for all organisms."

          "trans_context": "Metabolic regulation can be divided into multiple levels. In self-regulation, the metabolic pathway can be self-regulating to respond to changes in the level of the substrate or product; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can cause an increase in the flux of the pathway, thereby compensating for the amount of product. This type of regulation involves allosteric modulation of the activity of multiple enzymes in the pathway. In multicellular organisms, cells respond to changes in their metabolism by receiving signals from other cells, and this is external regulation. These signals are usually delivered by soluble molecules, such as hormones and growth factors, which specifically bind to specific receptor molecules on the cell surface. Upon binding to the receptor, the signal is delivered to the interior of the cell via a second messenger system, which typically involves phosphorylation of the protein. Glucose metabolism regulated by insulin is an example of a well-studied external regulation. The body's synthetic insulin is used to respond to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor on the cell surface and then activates a series of protein kinase cascades that enable cells to take up glucose and convert it into energy storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by phosphorylase and glycogen synthase, the former can degrade hepatic sugar, while the latter can synthesize glycogen. These enzymes are mutually regulated: phosphorylation inhibits glycogen synthase activity but activates phosphorylase activity. Insulin reduces the phosphorylation of the enzyme by activating protein phosphatase, allowing the glycogen to be synthesized."

A third possibility is that some parts of the metabolism can exist in a \"module\" manner, and modules can be used in different ways and perform similar functions on different molecules."

Monosaccharides can be linked together by glycosidic bonds to form polysaccharides, and the manner of attachment is extremely diverse, resulting in a diversity of polysaccharide species. Deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid are the two main classes of nucleic acids, all of which are linear molecules formed by the attachment of nucleotides. Nucleic acid molecules are essential for the storage and utilization of genetic information, through transcription and translation to complete the process from genetic information to protein. These genetic information is protected by a DNA repair mechanism and amplified by deoxyribonucleic acid replication. Some viruses contain a ribonucleic acid genome that can use reverse transcription to synthesize a deoxyribonucleic acid template from viral ribonucleic acid. Ribonucleic acid in ribozymes also have enzyme-like properties that catalyze chemical reactions. A single nucleotide is formed by a ribose molecule attached to a base. Among them, the base is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring and can be classified into two types: purine and pyrimidine.

Each type of group transfer reaction is carried out by a specific coenzyme, which is also a substrate for synthesizing it and a series of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are continuously produced, consumed, and recycled. Adenosine triphosphate is one of the most important coenzymes in living organisms and is a common form of energy circulation in cells. Adenosine triphosphate is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. Although there is only a small amount of adenosine triphosphate in the cell, it is continuously synthesized, and the amount of adenosine triphosphate consumed by the body in one day can be accumulated to reach its own body weight. Adenosine triphosphate is a bridge linking anabolism and catabolism: catabolic reactions produce adenosine triphosphate, while anabolic reactions consume adenosine triphosphate. It can also participate in the phosphorylation reaction as a carrier of the phosphate group."

The most important ions in the body are metal ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, and chloride, phosphate and bicarbonate ions. Maintaining an accurate ion gradient inside and outside the cell membrane maintains the stability of the osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also indispensable for nerves and muscle tissue because the action potentials in these tissues are produced by electrolyte exchange between extracellular fluid and cellular protoplasts. The entry and exit of electrolytes into cells is accomplished by ion channel proteins on the cell membrane. For example, muscle contraction relies on the control of the flow of calcium ions, potassium ions, and sodium ions by ion channels located on cell membranes and transverse tubules. Transition metals are usually present as trace elements in living organisms, with zinc and iron being the most abundant. These metal elements are used as cofactors by some proteins or are critical for the development of enzyme activities, such as oxygen-carrying heme and catalase. These cofactors bind tightly to specific proteins; although the cofactors of the enzyme are modified during the catalytic process, these cofactors are always able to return to the initial state after the catalysis is completed."

The purpose of the catabolic reaction is to provide the energy and reactants needed for the anabolic reaction. The mechanism of catabolism is different in organisms. For example, organic trophic bacteria decompose organic molecules to obtain energy, while inorganic trophic bacteria use inorganic substances as energy sources, and light energy utilization bacteria can absorb sunlight and convert them into available chemical energy. However, all of these metabolic forms require the participation of redox reactions, which primarily transfer electrons from reducing donor molecules to acceptor molecules. In animals, these reactions also involve the breakdown of complex organic molecules into simple molecules. In photosynthetic organisms, these electron transfer reactions do not release energy, but rather serve as a means of storing absorbed light energy. The most common catabolic reactions in animals can be divided into three main steps: first, macromolecular organic compounds such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids are digested and broken down into small molecular components; these small molecules are then taken up by cells and It is converted into smaller molecules, in which part of the energy is released; finally, the acetamidine group is oxidized to water and carbon dioxide through the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, and releases energy, which can be passed through nicotine The indoleamine adenine dinucleotide is reduced to nicotine indoleamine adenine dinucleotide and stored in the form of chemical energy."

Amino acids can be used to synthesize proteins or other biomolecules, and can be oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide to provide energy. The first step in the oxidation is the removal of the amine group on the amino acid by a transaminase, which is then fed to the urea cycle, leaving the deaminated carbon skeleton in the form of a keto acid. A variety of keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle. In addition, glycosamino acids can be converted to glucose by glucose nascent action."

Wheat is one of the three largest cereals, almost all of which is consumed as food, and only about one-sixth is used as feed. In 2013, wheat was the third largest food crop in the world, second only to corn and rice. Genomics studies have shown that: 2.5 million years ago, the wheat genus was separated from the aegilops. One million years ago, the wheat genus evolved into two types of reproductive isolation: one wheat, and the Uraltu wheat. 500,000 years ago, the Uraltu wheat and the Aegilops sylvestris hybridized to form two grains of wheat and Timofivi, both of which were tetraploid. At the end of the last ice age of 14,000 years ago, humans entered the Neolithic Age. The wheat genus was only the above four wild species, distributed in the west to the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula and east to the narrow area of the outer Caucasus. The area belongs to the Mediterranean climate, which is hot and dry in summer and mild and rainy in winter. In order to survive the long summer, the genus of wheat is an annual herb. The seeds germinate before the arrival of winter, and the winter is in the form of seedlings. In the spring, the flowers grow rapidly and the plants are dead. Before the arrival of the summer, all the plants die, leaving only the seeds in the soil to wait for the winter. arrival. This annual model allows plants to store their nutrients in the seeds as much as possible. In order to collect and grind wheat, the residents of the Xinyuewo Land Belt began to grind stone shovel and shovel. This kind of grinding stone is a sign of entering the Neolithic Stone."

Subsequently, the second wheat was domesticated. 8000 years ago, in the outer Caucasus and today's Iranian Caspian coast, the cultivated sow had occasionally crossed with the Aegilops gracilis to form common wheat, which is a hexaploid. Because ordinary wheat is more cold-tolerant and environmentally tolerant, it quickly replaced one wheat and two wheat, making it the most familiar wheat widely cultivated by humans.

Since the emergence of wheat in Xinjiang, China, and other places, wheat has experienced a process of expansion from west to east and from north to south in China. Archaeological evidence shows that in the hundreds of years since the beginning of Longshan culture, wheat has appeared almost simultaneously in the Hexi Corridor, the Guanzhong Plain, and the Yellow Sea. In the Oracle, the pictograph \"来来\" is used to indicate wheat, the upper part symbolizes mature wheat, and the lower part symbolizes wheat root. Also because of the arrival of \"coming\", Oracle borrowed the word \"come\" to mean \"arrival.\" Later, in order to distinguish the same meaning from the same word, a \"攵\" indicating the meaning of walking was added to the word \"来来\", which became the shape of the word. In the Western Han Dynasty, stone grinding was invented, and the technology of grinding flour gradually matured, and the development of \"powder food\". It can be said that the pasta culture is indeed derived from the Western Han Dynasty. Noodles and taro and other delicious pasta, after the Tang and Song Dynasties, wheat has become one of the staple foods of North China residents. In the Tang Dynasty's \"Herbal Supplements\", the value of wheat was affirmed: \"Wheat noodles, tonic, solid skin, thick stomach, strong strength.\" Sweet, cool. Can raise the heart and benefit the spleen, and the five internal organs, adjust the meridians, in addition to annoying thirst, and urinate."

Subsequently, his younger brother, Mu Yuan, published his doctoral thesis in 1924, pointing out that 14 of the 28 chromosomes of Emmer are similar to the chromosome of a wheat, indicating that the second wheat is likely to be one wheat and the other contains 14 A hybrid product of a plant of a chromosome. These findings have changed the way in which former botanists and wheat breeders classified the wheat genus from appearance to form, and the more they were subdivided into dozens. For example, in the past, the two-grain wheat was divided into three different species, namely, the type of wild heading, the type of cultivated skin, and the type of cultivated naked, and it was found from the chromosome point that all belonged to the same species. Muyuan first proposed genomic analysis in wheat genetic research; and created the terms homologous polyploid and heteropolyploid to distinguish different sources of chromosomes in polyploidy. Through genomic analysis techniques, Muhara published the conclusions of the study on the complete set of chromosomes of common wheat from Aegilops in 1940. In 1955, 1959, and 1963, Muhara made three trips to the Azerbaijan scientific expedition in West Asia, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union, confirming that the birthplace of wheat was Azerbaijan and its surrounding areas on the west coast of the Caspian Sea. This conclusion was later confirmed by genomics research."

In the United States, people with celiac disease are estimated to account for 0.5–1% of the total population. Few people with African, Japanese, and Chinese blood are found to have celiac disease. Celiac disease is more prevalent in women than in men. Celiac disease is a disease caused by an adverse reaction of the immune system to bran. Bran is a gluten protein found in wheat. The only effective way to treat celiac disease is to have a gluten-free diet for life. Undoubtedly the main value of wheat is that it can be ground into flour and become the main food for human beings. Especially in Europe, America and other temperate regions, wheat is an essential food for people. The world's production and acreage of wheat ranks first in cultivated cereals, with the widest range of common wheat, accounting for more than 90% of the world's total wheat area; the durum wheat planting area is about 6 to 7% of the total area. In addition to human consumption, flour is only used in small quantities to produce starch, alcohol, gluten, etc. After processing, by-products are high-quality feed for livestock. By 2012, China accounted for the largest number of the world's fifteen wheat-producing countries, followed by India, the United States and France."

The territory includes the entire provinces of China, Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, as well as eastern Inner Mongolia and Chengde City, Hebei Province. In the early days of Manchuria, the Republican system was the head of the Qing Dynasty. The name of the emperor was Yizheng. The title was \"ruling\" and the year number was \"Datong\". In March 1934, the government was changed to an empire, the country was Manchuria, and the \"ruling\" was renamed \"the emperor\". No. \"Kant\". Although nominally an independent country, Japan has made Manchuria a Japanese colony in disguise by signing the \"Japan-Japan Protocol\" and the Kwantung Army's continued presence in Manchuria. In August 1945, the Japanese mainland was attacked by the US atomic bomb. The Soviet Red Army attacked the Kwantung Army and the Manchurian Army, and Japan was defeated. In the same year, from midnight on August 17 to early morning on the 18th, Puyi trained in the Da Lizigou Mine Co., Ltd. in Linjiang County, Tonghua County. The abdication ceremony was held within the institute to read the \"Abandonment Letter\". After the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Pu Yi was captured by the Soviet Red Army. With the end of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Manchuria officially died.

The long-standing academic view held by the Vatican recognizes the Puppet Manchukuo, and therefore bears a historical stain that is difficult to rise up in the Sino-Vatican relationship. Of course, this view is not groundless, but a detailed comparison of domestic and foreign, domestic and foreign Catholicism, and a large number of historical archival documents published in Giovanni Coco’s \"The Holy See and Manchuria\" in 2006.

He went to Lieutenant for two years. He went to Shangyu for two years and went to the major for three years. The major entered the lieutenant colonel for three years, and the lieutenant colonel entered the colonel for three years. The colonel entered the major general in 4 years, the general general entered the lieutenant in 3 years, and the lieutenant entered the ranks in 4 years. The highest rank is the general, and he is a tenured. In June 1937, a general was established on the upper general, modeled after the Japanese marshal, as the honorary rank.

After the outbreak of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in 1937, Japan gradually transferred the Kwantung Army to the Chinese battlefield, and the defense of Manchuria's national borders became increasingly empty. So in 1938, the National Arms Law was promulgated, stipulating that men between the ages of 20 and 23 had three years of military service. . Each year, 200,000 people are recruited for military training, mainly as an engineering soldier, building a military fortress, or assisting the police in maintaining local security. Those who are not suitable for military service are required to participate in the three-year \"hardworking team\" and engage in civil engineering. By the summer of 1945, the Kwantung Army had to implement a complete mobilization plan for the 250,000 Japanese in Manchuria. At the end of July of the same year, the East Army troops were upgraded to 24 divisions with 700,000 troops. Most of them were newly established troops and equipment.

Since 1940, it has been fully implemented in China and has begun to adopt the incentive system. After the outbreak of the Japan-US Pacific War in 1941, the full government began to intensify its plunder due to the sharp rise in food demand in Japan. First, the Central Purchasing Corporation was merged to establish the Manchuria Agricultural Commune to manage agricultural products. Secondly, the incentive system was abolished, and the pre-purchase contract system was adopted to plan the collection of agricultural products. In 1943, the pre-purchase contract system was abolished. At the beginning of the provincial governor meeting, the county's responsibility was determined, and various indicators were issued to increase the grain plundering area and variety. Harbin's current output rate was as high as 89.9%. At the end of Manchuria in 1945, the “fed food” that farmers needed to turn in accounted for 51% of the country's total output. Opium is also a very important crop in Manchuria. It can be traced back to the 1933, when the Kwantung Army merged the Rehe Province into Manchuria. Some local military and political forces originally had the practice of planting opium, and the cultivation of this crop after the merger with Manchuria. Supported by about 1936, the planting area was expanded in the seven provinces of Manchuria, and production was vigorously produced. Then, the monopoly of opium was determined by law. In 1942, the Japanese \"Xingya Academy\" held the \"Popular Opium Needs Conference\" and made \" The Manchuria and Mongolian supply of opium needs in the Greater East Asia Common Circle, and the expansion of the planting area to 3,000 hectares in Manchuria, the opium industry reached its peak."

It was the largest local industrial body in China until the Cultural Revolution. At that time, the former Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the then General Director of the Ministry of Industry of the Manchu State Department, Mr. Kenneth Kwan, said to the Kwantung Army that \"if there is no chaebol or capitalist, it will be impossible to carry out the initial state-building project\" and introduce the chaebol investment from Japan. The money of the chaebol quickly flooded into Manchuria. In this way, we entered the Nissan Chronicle of Manchuria Yoshikawa, and owned 130 companies including Hitachi, Nissan, Japan Mining, and Japan Chemical Industry. It is a large chaebol with 150,000 employees. Manchuria adopts the economic control policy for the industrial sector and implements the principle of \"one industry, one society\". Each industry has established a \"special club\" - a monopolistic company. The reason why Manchu was accepted for reorganization was that Matsuoka Yosuke, the president of Manchuria, was the wife of Uncle Kishi, who was the intimate of Sugawara. Due to the shortage of materials caused by the war, the State Council formulated the \"metal recycling law\" at the end of Manchuria."

The forced labor is assessed according to the household registration, not limited to Han civilians, and the Manchurian settlements are not spared."

The annual income of employees, employees and domestic workers is 164. Yuan, 109 yuan and 80.99 yuan. The Manchurian locals are divided into five levels: domestic helper, regular employer, permanent employer, contractor and temporary worker. The highest annual income of the domestic helper is only 15.73 yuan, far lower than the Japanese. Most of Manchuria’s economy is controlled by Japanese employers, while workers are mostly Manchurians. Workers have a poor working environment and their salaries are often crushed.

The letters of the people of Manchuria who supported the independence of Manchuria were compiled into a book and are still collected in some libraries. This information was considered by the Manchurian researchers after the war to be a Japanese-led political propaganda. Shortly after the founding of Manchuria, the Japanese politician Ozaki Ozaki, who is known as the \"father of parliamentary politics,\" asserted: \"If the 30 million people who live in Manchuria hold a free vote, most of them oppose the establishment of Manchuria. In the absence of Japan’s military and financial assistance, Manchuria’s fears will only collapse in a few months... If this is the case, Manchuria will be recognized as the only one in Japan, not an independent country.” Yamaichi Shinichi believes that The assertion can be said to be quite correct."

Liquid cell - is another saclike monolayer of membrane cells that play different roles in the cell and can be large or small in shape. Usually the liquid cells of plants are larger. In protozoa, such as paramecium, liquid cells act as telescopic bubbles, collecting and excreting excess water; most plant cell cells occupy most of the cell volume after cell maturation, and can store water and store pigments. The liquid cells of some kinds of plants can assist the photosynthesis, and the liquid cells also have a great function: to assist the cells to evolve in the direction of large volume, and to make the surface area of the cytoplasm larger and facilitate the exchange of substances."

In particular, the mitochondria have their own genetic molecules. Unlike the genetic material of the nucleus, they only inherit the daughters of this organelle, not the daughter cells, which allow the mitochondria to self-divide and proliferate. Some proteins, but there are still some regulatory processes that are affected by the nucleus, and more importantly, the mitochondrial genes are only inherited in the maternal line, and do not follow the Mendelian laws, which helps to study the study of human evolution. It must be noted that the \"line\" granules should not be mistakenly written as \"glandular\" granules. The reason why the mitochondria are so called is because there are two main types of appearance under the microscope. It is a double-layered membrane organelle. The outer membrane is smooth, and the inner membrane is formed into a wrinkle-like structure inside. In order to increase the surface area of physiological action, the entanglement is filled with receptors, and many of them undergo metabolic reactions. The chloroplast is also a double-membrane organelle. Similar to the mitochondria, it also has its own genetic material, which can divide itself and proliferate, and make a protein that itself needs. The main function is to absorb light energy, convert it into chemical energy, and thereby synthesize inorganic matter into organic matter. This process of producing nutrients by light energy is called photosynthesis, light means light energy, and combination means synthesis."

Therefore, cell differentiation refers to the process by which homologous cells undergo a division and undergo a stable difference in morphology, structure and function. The essence of cell differentiation is the result of gene-selective expression. The phenomenon that genes are activated sequentially according to certain programs during the development of an individual is called the differential or sequential expression of genes. That is, not all genes are active at the same time, but some are active, some are inactive, some cells are active in this part of the gene, and some cells are active in other genes. Tissue-specific genes and housekeeping genes are genes that maintain the most basic life activities of cells, and are required for all cells to translate the structural and functional proteins necessary for basic life activities. These genes are called \"housekeeping genes\" and they have little to do with cell differentiation. Such as the gene encoding a protein involved in cell division, energy metabolism, and basic cell construction. The other type is the gene for translating specific proteins, which is not directly related to the basic survival of cells, but is closely related to cell differentiation and is called a luxury gene."

The most prominent phenomenon of cell death is the coagulation of protoplasm. In fact, cell death is a gradual process, and it is more difficult to determine when a cell has died. Unless it is artificially killed by a human factor such as a fixative. It is common to use live staining to identify whether a cell is dead. When stained with neutral red, only the vacuole is stained red in the living cells. If the dye spreads, the cytoplasm and nucleus are stained red, indicating that the cell has died. Apoptosis is an active, genetically determined process that automatically ends life, so it is often referred to as stylized cell death. Apoptotic cells will be engulfed by phagocytic cells. This hypothesis is based on the Hafrek boundary: in 1961, Heiferk was proposed based on subculture experiments of human embryonic cells. It refers to the normal natural death of cells at a certain stage of development, which is fundamentally different from the pathological death of cells. Apoptosis plays a key role in the normal development of multicellular organisms, the maintenance of homeostasis and the resistance to various external factors. For example: the disappearance of the appendix, apoptosis of the bone marrow and intestine, the development of the nervous system of the vertebrate, and the formation of the hands and feet during development."

Fossil evidence can infer that life evolved into eukaryotic cells about 2.1 billion years ago. The most characteristic feature of eukaryotic cells is that they contain a nuclear envelope surrounded by membranes to store DNA. Prokaryotic cells are simpler and therefore smaller than eukaryotic cells. They do not have nuclei and various organelles in eukaryotic cells. There are two types of prokaryotic cells: bacteria and archaea; they have a similar structure. The nuclear material that constitutes a prokaryotic cell is a single chromosome that is in direct contact with the cytoplasm. This area that is not completely isolated from the cytoplasm is called a pseudonucleus. Structurally, prokaryotic cells are divided into three regions: shape, flagella, and cilia to protect the surface of cells. This structure of proteins allows cells to move freely and facilitate communication between cells."

The cell membrane is the interface in the cell structure that separates different media and components within and outside the cell. Protoplasmic membranes are generally thought to be repeated by a phospholipid bilayer molecule as a basic unit with various types of membrane proteins and sugars and glycolipids bound to membrane proteins. The plasma membrane is an important channel for material exchange and information transmission between cells and the surrounding environment and between cells and cells. The protoplast membrane achieves selective, regulatable transport of substances through certain properties of the pores and transmembrane proteins thereon. The cell membrane is like a plastic bag filled with liquid, colloidal cytoplasm that can be roughly divided into cytoplasmic stroma and organelles. The cytoplasm contains essential substances required for life-sustaining phenomena, such as sugars, lipids, proteins, and ribonucleic acids involved in protein synthesis. Therefore, it is also the main place for the entire cell to operate. It is regulated by signals received outside the cell membrane and substances inside the cell. The performance of genes affects physiological activities. In addition, there are many cytoplasmic structures inside the cytoplasm, called cytoskeleton, which can help maintain the shape of the cells and also guide the movement of internal substances. Some cytoskeletons form a spindle that can be observed through staining when the cells divide. The skeleton is more helpful for cell movement."

Therefore, spacecraft near Lagrange Point 1 and Lagrange Point 2 actually need to rely on their own propulsion system for orbital maintenance. Some aerospace projects have already used the Lissajous orbit. In 1997, an advanced component detector for the observation of the sun was launched around the Lagrange point 1 of the solar-terrestrial system. The Wilkinson microwave anisotropy detector launched in 2001 was operated around the Lagrange point 2 of the solar-ground system. The Herschel Space Observatory and Planck Satellite, launched on May 14, 2009, operate around Lagrange Point 2 of the Japan-Earth System. The planned James Webb Space Telescope and Gaia mission will be placed at Lagrange Point 2 of the Japan-Earth System."

Raw materials such as glass have become the largest state in southern Africa in the 15th century. The prosperity of the Shona civilization came to an end in the 19th century. In 1837, the Shona people were conquered by the Ndebeele people belonging to the Zulu people, and the Poles from the UK and from the south began to gradually eat into the area.

This move caused a large number of white farmers to leave the country and the economy was in chaos. However, the Zimbabwean government was sorry about this and announced plans to reintroduce white investment. In 2002, Mugaby was re-elected. Opposition parties and labor organizations have launched strikes and struggles, demanding that Mugabeti step down early and the government will suppress it with military and police forces. The International Monetary Fund-led financial assistance creditor country accused the Mugabe regime of defying human rights and fraud in the election, and shelved the aid program.

The official language is Hungarian, the most widely used non-Indo-European language in Europe. After the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated. In March 1919, the Hungarian Soviet Republic was established. In August of the same year, it was overthrown by the army headed by Holsi, and the Hungarian kingdom of the constitutional monarchy was restored. In 1920, the defeated country Hungary signed the Trianon Treaty with the Allies, losing 72% of the territory and 64% of the population. In 1941, Hungary joined the German-Israeli-Japan Axis Group. In 1944, the Soviet Union occupied Hungary. On February 1, 1946, it was announced that the monarchy was abolished and the Republic of Hungary was established. In 1949, the Constitution was renamed the Hungarian People's Republic. On August 20, 1949, the Hungarian People's Republic was announced. Most of Hungary is a plain in the Carpathian Basin, with hills and mountains at the northern border with Slovakia. The Danube divides the country into two parts. Other rivers include the Tisza and Drava rivers. The western Balaton Lake is the main water body and the largest freshwater lake in Europe. Lake Heviz, the world's largest hot spring lake, is also in Hungary. The capital Budapest is known as the pearl on the Danube. Hungarian is located in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. It is the intersection of continental climate, temperate maritime climate and Mediterranean climate. It is affected by continental climate and belongs to temperate continental climate. The climate change in Hungary is relatively large, and the temperature difference between different regions is also large. The annual average temperature is 10.8 °C. The average temperature in July and August is 21.7 °C. Winter is not very cold, with an average temperature of -1.2 °C in January and February.

The movements of aerospace dynamics include the centroid motion of spacecraft, orbital motion; the motion of spacecraft relative to its own centroid and the relative motion of various parts, called attitude motion; and the launch of spacecraft, orbiting maneuvering of spacecraft Rocket movement. The flight process of a spacecraft is generally divided into three phases. Launch segment: The spacecraft is carried by the carrier and takes off from the ground to a predetermined altitude and speed. Running track segment: The spacecraft mainly moves under the influence of natural forces such as gravitation. In order to maintain a predetermined orbit, a small amount of thrust is sometimes required; sometimes a large thrust is required for orbital maneuvers. Landing orbital segments: Some spacecraft need to return to the surface of the Earth or land on the surface of the target celestial body. At this time, the spacecraft dropped from the running track to the surface of the celestial body under the action of rocket thrust and medium resistance. In each of the above stages, the movement of the spacecraft includes both orbital motion and attitude motion. In the running track segment, it is generally possible to solve the two motions separately. In the launch section and the landing section, the two movements are closely related and need to be solved in a simultaneous manner. The study of spacecraft motion is based on Newtonian mechanics and rocket mechanics, and generally does not consider relativistic effects. Aerospace dynamics is based on mathematics, mechanics, and control theory. Its research content is divided into three parts: orbital motion, attitude motion and rocket motion."

Since the basic force of controlling natural celestial bodies is universal gravitation, and the self-loading power of man-made aircraft is different from the natural inertial force, it derives the science of space dynamics and is an important subject of orbital mechanics. So far, the orbital motion theory of artificial celestial bodies is still the research topic of celestial mechanics.

By the end of the 1970s, the problem of the attitude movement of a spacecraft with a rigid body as its main body had been basically solved.

Due to the complexity of the satellite structure, the mechanical model has also evolved from a rigid body model to a variety of models, which is more closely related to spacecraft design. Attitude motion research is both a theoretical issue and an engineering application problem. Rocket motion is the motion of a variable mass system governed by classical mechanics. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Soviet Union's Tsiolkovsky and the United States Goddard and others carried out the theory of motion theory of variable mass systems.

Orbital theory is the basis of orbital design and orbit determination. In the orbital perturbation theory, the orbit of the actual movement of the spacecraft is divided into two parts. Some of them are simplified theoretical orbits that have been completely solved. It is very close to the exact theoretical orbit.

Another purpose of studying orbital perturbation is to analyze the cause of orbital perturbation by comparing with the measured orbit, and to provide information for the study of the gravitational field, the shape of the celestial body, and the gas layer around the celestial body. In addition to the orbital perturbation method, numerical calculations can be performed directly using the equation of motion of the spacecraft to obtain accurate numerical results. The focus of the study of the orbital section of the landing track is the high-speed movement of the spacecraft in the atmosphere.

Choosing the most advantageous orbit according to the mission of the spacecraft is the main work of the track design. The increase in rocket carrying capacity and control accuracy has expanded the range of orbital options. Since people have mastered the laws of orbital motion, practical geostationary satellite orbits, return orbits, sun-synchronous orbits, polar orbits, halo orbits have been designed. Communications satellites, broadcasting satellites, Earth resource satellites, reconnaissance satellites, and meteorological satellites operate on these orbits. In the lunar exploration and planetary exploration activities, it is mostly aimed at approaching the target celestial body. The number of tracks to achieve this goal is large, and the task of track design is to choose the best track. This track should be able to achieve minimum power consumption or minimum flight time, the simplest control method, and the most convenient ground observation. The selected track always has errors in the implementation process. Another task of the track design is to try to control the error within the range that does not affect the mission of the flight. For aerodynamic spacecraft, the orbital design is also related to the spacecraft's powertrain and control systems. Therefore, the track design is the application of the orbital theory in engineering."

In the early celestial mechanics, the object of orbit determination is a natural celestial body, and a complete measurement method has been formed. These methods are in principle applicable to the orbit determination of space vehicles. However, compared with natural objects, the spacecraft has a high angular velocity of motion and maintains radio contact with the ground station. There are many measuring methods, and the data types are large and large. In addition, the orbit determination of spacecraft requires high precision and timeliness is often strong, thus gradually forming some unique methods. The basic theories of orbit determination include orbital perturbation theory, orbital error estimation theory, and calculation methods for high-dimensional linear equations. When studying the attitude movement of a spacecraft, the spacecraft is no longer seen as a mass point. The attitude motion of a spacecraft can be divided into an overall motion around the centroid and a relative motion between the components of the spacecraft."

          "trans_context": "The research of rocket motion is based on variable mass mechanics and classical mechanics. Its mission is to find the motion state of the rocket at any time and analyze the stability of the rocket's attitude motion. The rocket's centroid movement is also known as rocket orbital motion. The research content in this aspect includes: establishing the rocket motion equation and solving it. The equation of motion of the rocket includes the equation of motion of the centroid and the equation of motion around the centroid. The controlled rocket has a given control torque in the equation of motion around the centroid. The main method for solving this set of equations is the numerical calculation method. Rocket Orbit Optimization: There are many rocket tracks that can reach the target, and one of the best tracks needs to be selected. Under the conditions of ground tracking measurement and navigation safety, this track is the most energy-saving or shortest running track, or it may be the farthest or the most loaded orbit. The method of rocket orbit optimization is divided into indirect optimization method and direct optimization method. Rocket Orbital Perturbation: Analyze the state of motion of the rocket as it is disturbed. Such interference includes the deviation of the rocket's characteristic parameters and design theoretical values, the deviation of the flight environment from the pre-estimated values, and so on. Establish the relationship between the parameters of rocket motion and rocket design."

The Tang Dynasty was born from the Guanzuo family. The ancestor Li Hu was one of the Eight Pillars in the Western Wei Dynasty in the Southern and Northern Dynasties and was named Tang Guogong. Li Yuan, the descendant of the dynasty, stayed behind in Jinyang, and went to Guanzhong in the end of the Ming Dynasty to compete for the world. In 618, he was appointed by the Emperor Yang of the Tang Dynasty to establish the Tang Dynasty in the Tang Dynasty and unified the world in the Tang Dynasty unified war. The Tang Dynasty was in Chang'an. And set up Dongdu Luoyang, Beidu Jinyang and other accompanying capital. The history of the Tang Dynasty can be roughly divided into several periods, roughly bounded by the chaos of Anshi. In the early Tang Dynasty, the national power was strong, Tang Gaozu established the dynasty, and Tang Taizong changed the brothers Li Jiancheng and his brother Li Yuanji, and forced his father Gao Zuzen to make the beginning of the Tang Dynasty many times. Tang Taizong took the Tang Dynasty to the prosperous world and defeated the strong enemy Dongtuo. Tang Taizong was respected by \"Tian Khan\" and achieved the rule of Zhenguan. During the Gaozong period of Tang Dynasty, he defeated the powerful enemies such as Xituo and Goguryeo, established the rule of Yonghui, and expanded the layout of the Tang Dynasty to the maximum. After the death of Tang Gaozong, Wu Zetian changed his name to \"Week\" in 690, that is, Wu Zhou, the female host politics reached its peak. Until 705, Tang Zhongzong was restored due to the Shenlong revolution, and the Tang Dynasty was restored. But then there was the Privilege of Wei Queen. The ancestral Li Longji and the aunt Princess Taiping jointly initiated the change of Tang Long, only to sweep away the Weishi forces and end the situation of political chaos since the restoration of Tang Zhongzong. Li Longji also took power and became the Tang Xuanzong of the future."

When fashion is there, such as Li Ji, Su Dingfang, Xue Rengui, etc., the famous ministers Sun Wuji, Yan Liang and so on. Internally, we will continue to implement the equalization system and use lower-level but talented bureaucrats. In 659, the West Turkistan was destroyed, and the territory was expanded to the Aral Sea and the Amu River. Anxidu Hufu was established in the Broken Leaf City. In the west of Congling, there are 16 Dudufu government houses, and the Central Asian monarchs, such as the Tubo Luoye, the King of Daluo, and the Dudu. In the East, together with Silla, the Northeast Powers Goguryeo and Baekje were eliminated, and the Battle of Baijiangkou defeated the Japanese reinforcements. The establishment of the An Dong Du Hufu on the Korean Peninsula by the Tang Dynasty also indirectly prompted Silla to unify the Korean Peninsula."

Wu Zetian was a talented person in the Taizong period, and Taizong was recruited into the palace by Gao Zong. She won the power struggle and was established as a queen. The history is called \"Su Duo Zhi Ji, and is involved in the history of literature.\" Since 656, due to health reasons, many political affairs have been handed over to Wu Zetian for treatment. Wu Zetian has become one of the supreme rulers, and Gao Zong is also called \"two holy.\" After Gao Zong’s death, Prince Li Xian was in place and was Tang Zhongzong. Because of the disagreement with Zhongzong, Wu Zetian soon abandoned Zhongzong as the king of Fuling, and changed the four sons Li Dan to the emperor, which was Tang Ruizong. After Wu Zeping decided Xu Jingye's rebellion, in 690, he retired Ruizong, the emperor, changed the country to Zhou, that is, Wu Zhou, Dingdu Luoyang, and changed Li Dan to Huangfu, becoming the only female emperor in Chinese history. During the period when Wu Zetian took power and became emperor, the country had greater development than the period of Zhenguan. The implementation of the equalization system continued to promote the development of agricultural production; the system of imperial examinations was further improved, and the examinations and martial arts were initiated. Wu Zetian attacked the Guanyu Group since the Western Wei Dynasty and vigorously promoted officials from the civil service. He was called the \"Beimen Bachelor\", many of whom were from Kanto and Jiangnan. And vigorously promote talents, such as Di Renjie, Zhang Cambodia, Zhang Renyuan, Yao Chong and other famous generals. Culture and art have also made progress. At that time, Buddhism was flourishing, and Buddhist temples in the Wu Zhou period were frequently built. However, another characteristic of Wu Zetian's ruling is the strong control, mainly including the severe suppression of Xu Jingye and other opposition parties, the slaughter of the Tang dynasty prince and the support of the Tang dynasty minister. Encourage whistle-blowing, secretly monitor bureaucracy, princes, and promote the cool system. Supporting Wu Sansi, Shangguan Yuer and other party members.

At that time, the politics of the Tang Dynasty were increasingly corrupted. Tang Xuanzong proposed to use Wu and Wei as the precepts and to take the example of Zhenguan as the guiding ideology of the ruling. He has successively appointed Yao Chong, Song Yi, Lu Huaishin, Zhang Jiuling and Han Xiu, and has acclaimed rumors. For example, adopting Zhang Jiuling’s suggestion, the talented person in the Jingguan can be transferred to the governor’s history to train administrative ability, and the pro-manager’s history is promoted to the official. Enhance communication, understanding and trust between the central and local governments. Reduce the number of officials such as foreign officials in the Wuzhong Zhongzong period, and streamline the organization in order to save expenses and improve administrative capacity. Strict enforcement of the law, suppression of power, even if the emperor is a crime, it is also brought to justice. It has a good influence on stabilizing social order.

On the external front, we will improve relations with Tubo, East Turkistan, Khitan and Yu, and implement policies. Follow the advice of Yao Chong and Song Yu, enrich the military defense, and avoid war with foreigners. These measures made the Tang Dynasty enter its second heyday, with a large population growth and abundant products. The history is called the rule of Kaiyuan. At that time, not only the Central Plains, the Jianghuai area, and the Chengdu Plain were economically developed, but the Longyou Hexi area with a small population also prospered."

The festival not only is responsible for the military, but also takes into account the local civil affairs and finances. The situation that has formed a long period of time to make the tails big and the big ones has become the far-reaching factor of the separation of the towns. On the external front, Tang Xuanzong was so happy that he would often provoke foreign wars to invite war. At that time, the Tang Dynasty was competing with the Tubo and black clothes for the forces in the Western Region and Central Asia, among which the 751-year-old Battle of Jurassic was the most famous. In the Tang Dynasty, Gao Xianzhi was defeated by the Abbasid dynasty and the Stone State Alliance and lost his position in Central Asia. Later, due to the outbreak of Anshi history in the Middle Kingdom, the Tang Dynasty did not intend to restore its status."

The Yongzheng Zen incident also enabled the eunuch to successfully defeat the foreign court and the scholar-officials. The eunuch who controlled the military and political power became the behind-the-scenes control of the central government. Most of the emperors after Tang Xianzong were arbitrarily abandoned by eunuchs. For example, the eunuch Wang Shoucheng is a good example. In 820, Tang Xianzong was poisoned by the eunuch Chen Hongzhi. Behind this incident was the instigation of the eunuch Wang Shoucheng. Wang Shoucheng supported the prince Li Wei as the successor, namely Tang Muzong. After he was in the throne, he had a lot of fun, and the three towns in Hebei rebelled, and the party struggle behind the eunuchs became more and more fierce. Tang Muzong passed away in three years, and his son Li Zhan succeeded, namely Tang Jingzong. The power was still controlled by Wang Shoucheng. Tang Jingzong also ignored the political affairs, and he specialized in playing and banqueting. In 826, Tang Jingzong went out to \"play the night fox\". After returning to the palace, he banqueted and was killed by the eunuch Liu Keming. Liu Keming intends to win the king's right to defend the king, and to hold the king Li Wu. After Wang Shoucheng learned that he was welcoming the son of Tang Muzong, Jiang Wang Li, and killed the political enemy. Li Ji succeeded, namely Tang Wenzong. At that time, Wang Shoucheng was the most powerful, followed by Chen Hongzhi and Qiu Shiliang."

In 831, the conspiracy with prime minister Song Shenxi failed, and Song Shenxi was killed. Later, Tang Wenzong and the ministers Li Xun and Zheng Zhu joined forces to launch a coup. They are all recommended by Wang Shoucheng, so the eunuch is not afraid. Li Zheng and the two first suggested that Tang Wenzong promoted Qiu Shiliang, who was not in harmony with Wang, and that the rod killed the Yuan and reversed the head of Chen Hongzhi, and killed some of the eunuchs. In 835, Tang Wenzong used Li Xun as the prime minister, Zheng Zhaozhang, Feng Xiang, and the internal and external echoes. Then the secret faction made the poison kill Wang Shoucheng, and both the Yuan and the counter-party were killed. Li Xun has expanded his power and military power, and he has been able to fight with the eunuch who only masters the gods. In 835, Li Xun launched the change of Ganlu, intending to rob the emperor from the eunuch, but the sergeant Qiu Shiliang robbed the emperor first, and defeated the political enemy with the gods and killed the minister. After the change of Ganlu, the eunuchs united to the outside world and firmly grasped the military and political power. The emperors and the ministers were decorated with ornaments. Even the later Tang Wuzong and Tang Xuanzong could not eliminate the eunuch's power. The minister can only use the town to fight against the eunuch's power, and bury the shadow of the late Tang Dynasty town to seize power. Tang Wenzong, who was unhappy in 840, passed away. His brother was succeeded by the eunuch Qiu Shiliang, namely Tang Wuzong. Because of the faction of the imperial faction at the time, Qiu Shiliang had to let Tang Wuzong personally handle the political affairs. Tang Wuzong re-uses Li Deyu to reduce the power of the enemy, and also proposes a series of revitalization of the imperial court. He vigorously promoted the elimination of Buddhism. Tang Wuzong pursued Taoism, hoping that he would live forever, and finally died because of taking medicine."

After Li Jizhen was informed, they suppressed these people. This caused the ruling and opposition. Li Jizhen finally lost power. The DPRK and Chinese ministers gradually formed two parties to fight each other. However, at that time, the chief war squad officer spoke up and took control of the power, so the Li party still gained momentum.

Political corruption, the gap between the rich and the poor in the society is too large, and many insurgents have occurred one after another. The Jiangnan area of the economic lifeline of the Tang Dynasty has also been destroyed, completely shaken the political power, and also produced Xinyu Towns such as Li Guochang and Zhu Quanzhong. In 859, Tang Yizong succeeded to the throne. He was arrogant and extravagant, and he favored eunuchs; he also believed in Buddhism. In order to worship the Buddha, he will not hesitate to cut military spending. After 860 years, there was a chaos, a change of Pang Xun and a change of Wang Xi. Among them, the change of Pang Xun's economy undermined the economy of the Kanto region, and it was determined by the leader of the Shatuo army, Zhu Xie, who was led by the army. Zhu Xianqi was given the name of Li Guochang. In 873, Tang Yizong succeeded to the throne, and he specialized in fighting against the chickens, ignoring the political affairs, and a larger rebellion was born in the north. Due to the floods in the Kanto year and the political corruption, the price of salt has risen sharply, making the thieves continue. In 874, Wang Xianzhi gathered in Changchun, and in the following year, he captured the western part of Shandong and flowed in the Huainan area of Henan Province. In 878, Wang Xianzhi died in Huangmei, and the rest fell to Huangchao. Huang Chao plundered Jiangnan and Lingnan from the south of the state, slaughtered along the road, and captured the commercial city of Guangzhou. The South China economy was almost completely destroyed. In 879, due to the plague of the army, Huang Chao led the army to the south of the Yangtze River. The following year, Huang Chao officially entered the west and captured Luoyang and Shaoguan. The commander of the sergeant Tian Lingzhen took Tang Yizong to flee to Sichuan, and Huang Chao entered Chang'an and built the country. The division of the Qin Wang was also disorganized because of the order, and the recovered Changan was taken back by Huang Chao. The Tang room had to be escorted to Li Guochang and Li Ke who used to defeat the desert north. Li Ke used the Shatuo army to assist Tang Junke to regain Changan. On the other hand, the Yellow Nest Department surrendered Zhu Wen and gave him the name Zhu Quanzhong. Huang Chaodong walked and surrounded Zhu Quanzhong in Chenzhou. In 884, Li Ke used the military to resolve the encirclement of Chenzhou and pursued Huang Chaojun. In the following year, Huang Chao was surrendered by his 甥林言, and the chaos of Huang Chao was settled. Later, Huang Chaojiang rebelled Qin Zongquan and led the army to attack in the Central Plains. He once captured the Eastern Capital, causing a situation of \"extraordinary and no fireworks\" until Zhu Zhaozhong was settled by Zhu Quanzhong."

Tian Lingqi and Wang Zhongrong made Wang Zhongrong sin, and both sides plucked the town and contend. Wang Chongrong and Li Ke successfully entered Chang'an with the coalition forces, and Tian Lingqi took Tang Yizong to take refuge in Beijing. Zhu Mei and Li Changfu, who originally cooperated with Tian Lingqi, also turned their backs and led the army to pursue Tian Lingqi. The two men enlisted Wang Lizhen to supervise the country, Li Wei was appointed prime minister, and Li Changfu was dissatisfied. In the Tang Dynasty of Xingyuan, he convinced Wang Chongrong, Li Keyong and Li Changfu to reconcile Changan. On the way back to Beijing, Tang Yuzong clashed with Feng Xiang Li Changfu. At that time, Wang Chongrong was killed by his subordinates. Tang Zongzong relied on Li Maozhen to be able to return to Chang'an, and Li Maozhen also succeeded Feng Xiang. In 888, Tang Yizong died, and his brother Li Wei was accused by the eunuch Yang Fugong, namely Tang Zhaozong. Xuanwu Zhu Quanzhong and Hedong Li Ke used each other for different reasons. Both sides went to the court and went down to the town. At that time, Zhang Quanyi and Li Hanzhi competed for the Heyang Festival, and both sides pulled Zhu Quanzhong and Li Ke to play against each other. As a result, Zhu Quanzhong won the battle and merged with Heyang and Luoyang. After defeating Qin Zongquan, he almost occupied Henan Province. At that time, the eunuch Yang Fugong and the prime minister Zhang Wei did not agree, and the two sides separately convinced Li Ke and Zhu Quanzhong. In 890, Zhu Quanzhong and Zhang Wei attacked the East Army and failed. Li Ke took advantage of the opportunity to swallow Zhaozhou and Zezhou, and occupied the area of Shanxi Province. Soon after the eunuch Yang Fugong lost power, the south relied on his brother's Shannan West Road to make Yang Shouliang rebellious, the Tang Dynasty was rebelled by Li Maozhen and others, and Li Ke used the imperial power of the court to decline. Feng Xiang Li Maozhen was unable to expand the site and did not agree with the Tang Emperor. In the end, Li Maozhen and Wang Xingyu defeated. They controlled the Guanzhong area.

          "trans_context": "The territory of the Tang Dynasty was vast, but it changed from time to time. In 630 years, it exceeded the territory of the Sui Dynasty. Since the Qin and Han Dynasties, the Tang Dynasty has not used the unified dynasty that built the Great Wall and did not build the Great Wall. Its heyday was in the 7th century, when the oasis of Central Asia was dominated by the Tang Dynasty. Its largest area is south to Luofu, North Xuanzang, West and Ang, and east to the vast territory of Gobe, with a land area of 10.76 million square kilometers. After the Middle Tang Dynasty, the territory of Mobei and the Western Regions were successively lost. In the late Tang Dynasty, it declined to the size of the Chinese headquarters, but still retained the Hetao area and the Hexi Corridor. Tianbao’s 13-year household registration statistics were 52,888,488. However, many scholars considered that the statistics were not strict at the time, and there were a large number of newspaper accounts that were not included in the statistics. In addition, there were hidden households and tenant farmers. People, slaves, soldiers, martyrdom and other people are not included in the household registration statistics, so most scholars believe that the Tang Dynasty population peaks at around 80 million. At this time, the population of the Chang'an area is estimated to be around 2 million, while the urban area is 1 million."

In the second year of Shenlong, Ten patrols, ten custodians, and ten patrols were established. These are the ombudsmen who are temporarily dispatched to the central government. They are not always placed and there is no fixed office. In the year of Kaiyuan, Kaiyuan Road was separated from Gyeonggi Province, and the road was divided from the South Road. The South Road was divided into East and West Roads. The South River Road was Jiangnan East, Jiangnan West and Yuzhong, with a total of fifteen roads.

After the peace of Anshi was settled, the Tang government increased the number of festivals, and the festivals called the jurisdiction of the town. The Tang government’s attempt to calm down some rebellions by means of the festivals, but these festivals make the soldiers self-respect. At the end of the Tang Dynasty, the administrative divisions of the three levels of Dao, Zhou and County were formed. In the late Tang Dynasty, there were forty or fifty towns in the country. Except for Jingzhao House and several surrounding states as well as Henan Province, the rest of the country was divided into two parts. During the Tang Dezong period, the rebellion of the town of Hehuang in the Hehuang area, the occupation of the Chang'an of the capital, and the escape of the Dezong to Hanzhong took four years to settle down. Since then, the disaster of the town has been expanding. Although during the Xianzong period, the forces of Wu Yuanji in Huaixi were settled, and the towns around the town went to the center, but they failed to remove the roots. After the death of Xianzong, the situation of the separation of the towns was revived. Finally, the Tang Dynasty finally died in the hands of Zhu Wen. The Five Dynasties and Ten States after the Tang Dynasty were actually a continuation of the disaster of the town, but some towns were completely independent. In terms of local administration, Tang Congxin is old and divided into two sub-districts. State-level political districts are often referred to as \"states\", with a history of thorns, a few called \"counties\", and counties. The county has a county magistrate.

In addition, there are three provinces with less authority in the central province, the provincial capital of the Emperor's room, the secretary of the province, and the provincial government. Shangshu Province is the highest administrative organ in the country. The central government is called “Shangshudu Province”. All of them are set up to set up six departments of 吏, household, ritual, military, criminal and industrial. The chief clerk is a book order, but because Tang Taizong once served as a book order, Take the left and right servant shots. Zhongshu Province is the emperor's institution that promulgated the Dazheng document. The chief is the Chinese book order, the deputy is the Chinese book assistant, and there are six Chinese scholars. In addition, the right-handed rider is a regular waiter and the right-handed husband and wife are eunuchs. The province under the door is the institution that audits the Dazheng documents. The chief is the assistant in the door, the deputy is the Huangmen assistant, and there are four people in the middle. In addition, similar to the Zhongshu province, there are left-handed riders, left-handed doctors and other eunuchs. There are also officials such as Fu Baolang, who is in charge of the printing, and the living lang, who is in the palm of his life. Because Shangshu’s power was too great, he set up the right and left servant to act on his behalf. The left and right servant is the prime minister. Later, the title of the second post to be added to the book under the book is the prime minister. However, the name of the book and the servant in the door are very high and not permanent. Therefore, the title of other administrations, including the participation in the political affairs, the gains and losses of the participation, and the three titles of the same book, is the prime minister. The prime minister usually discussed the political affairs in the political office, and the meeting of the political hall became the highest decision-making body to assist the emperor. To Xuanzong, the sentiment was made into a system, which was characterized by the disconnect between the official position and the position. The official only represents the level of the official position and the salary, and the actual duties are completely controlled by the emperor or the upper official. There are many \"make\" characters in the ranks of officers. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the Hanlin Academy was placed, and the bachelor participated in the deliberation and discussion of the table, and he specialized in the internal system, which caused a little threat to the rights of the province."

After the Xuanzong dynasty, the clan of the clan ceased to exist, but the scholars of the sects of the sects carried out the struggle of the cattle and Li parties. This party struggle lasted for forty years and seriously ruined the political affairs. The middle and late Tang Dynasty also became the three eunuch eras in Chinese history in the middle and late Eastern Han Dynasty and the late Ming Dynasty. In the early days, the eunuch did not have any power. Since the Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, the position of the eunuch has risen step by step and began to participate directly in politics. Later, with the eunuch's mastery of the military power, the emperor's abolition was in the hands of the eunuch. This is most prominent in the \"change of nectar\". After Zhu Quanzhong annihilated all the eunuchs, the Tang Dynasty soon died. It shows that the eunuch has formed a community of destiny with the emperor."

According to the \"Old Tang Book\", Tang Wude had 1.8 million households in the first year; Tang Wude had 2.19 million households in the seventh year, Tang Yanguan had three hundred and forty-four thousand households in the thirteen years, and Tang Taizong visited Guan Twenty-two years.

In the lower reaches of the region, the land south of the Huaihe River in the middle of the Tang Dynasty was extensively reclaimed and overhauled, and transplanted rice was transplanted, which greatly increased the grain output of Jianghuai and became an important grain producing area in the country. The manufacture of white sugar began in Tang Dynasty for twenty-one years. After the Song Dynasty, sugar cane was planted in the provinces south of the Yangtze River. The development of the cultivation of trafficking in tea has generated a large income for the southern economy. The custom of drinking tea has spread from the south to the north and has gradually become popular. The tea in the south is transported to the north through the Grand Canal and the land, to the Bohai Sea, and even to the Persian food. However, due to insufficient taxation and lack of national use, in the first month of the 9th year of the Yuan Dynasty, Yan Tie made Zhang Wei play in the main production of Chaju County and the traffic fortress, and appointed the Salt Iron Tie Branch to set up a tea farm, which was priced by the competent bureaucrats. Ten tax ones became an important national income after the middle of the Tang Dynasty, and thus became the beginning of the official establishment of tax tea in history."

The institutions directly managed are Shaofu, and will be supervised and supervised by the military. Shaofu Supervisor is in charge of exquisite handicrafts; he will be in charge of the construction of civil engineering; the military superintendent is responsible for the construction of weapons. Under the supervision of the establishment of a department, the establishment of a workshop. In addition, there are casting money supervision and smelting supervision. The products of the official handicraft industry are generally not sold to the public, and are only used by the royal family and the Tuen Mun. Workers are divided into artisans, criminals, official slaves, officials, and miscellaneous households. The private handicraft industry is less developed than the official handicraft industry. The main handicrafts in the early Tang Dynasty were the textile industry, ceramics industry and mining and metallurgy industry. Silk and hemp are the main textile objects. The shackles of Henan Road, the Jianghuai cloth are among the best varieties. The silk fabrics of the Tang Dynasty were widely dyed by the waxy method of the Northern Dynasties, and two new dyeing methods of pinch and twist were developed. The fabric pattern is also influenced by the Western Winds and reflects a few Persian styles. The fineness of white porcelain and the number of Tang Sancai can confirm the development of the ceramic industry at that time. Tang Sancai is mainly composed of yellow, green and white. It is a master of glazing technology at the time. Although it is a burial item, it is exquisitely made and involves all aspects of the Tang Dynasty society. The gold and silverware manufacturing industry draws on some technologies from the Western Region and uses the ash blowing method to achieve high purity of gold and silver. Huai Nan Yangzhou produced the same bronze mirrors such as the Abbot mirror and the Jiang Xinjing. In the middle of the Tang Dynasty, the southern handicraft industry made great progress, especially in the silk industry, paper industry and shipbuilding industry: the popularization of silkworms by the people, the use of bamboo and papermaking, and the manufacture of manpower pedal boats. The secret color porcelain produced by Yuezhou Yue Kiln is an outstanding representative of the southern ceramic industry in the late Tang Dynasty."

Its demarcation point can be divided into the chaos of Anshi and the promulgation of the two-tax law according to political and economic perspectives. Before the Anshi Rebellion, the Tang Dynasty's national strength was strong, the economy was prosperous, the military commanders opened up the territory, and the Wenchen stabilized the political affairs. It was the heyday of the Tang Dynasty. After the chaos, the Tang Dynasty encountered many problems and the national strength tends to decline. From an economic point of view, the first phase of the land system and the renting system were adopted. After Tang Dezong enacted the two tax laws, the land system and taxation system in the later period of China were basically based on the two tax laws. There are four methods for the more traditional methods, namely, the Tang Dynasty from Tang Gaozu to Tang Gaozong, the Tang Dynasty from Wu Zetian to Tang Xuanzong, the Tang Dynasty from Tang Suzong to Tang Wenzong, and Tang Wuzong to Tang Dynasty. The royal family of the Tang Dynasty had a strong sense of Xianbei. In addition to the possible extension of Tuoba, they served the Tuoba Department for a long time before they established the country. They also married other Xianbei nobles, such as Li Wei’s wife as the daughter of Duo Zhixin; Li Yuan’s wife Henan Dou, a granddaughter of Yu Wentai; Li Shimin's wife and grandson, Queen Empress, etc., was born in Henan Changsun, both are Xianbei Tuoba aristocrats. Therefore, scholars Shanshan Zhengming and others have classified the Sui and Tang Dynasties into the Tuoba countries."

In the early stage, the social economy was dominated by the natural economy, and the commodity economy was in a recovery phase with a very low standard. Under this circumstance, Qian Qian’s monetary system is better suited to the needs of small commodity transactions. However, with the end of the period of Zhenguan, especially the continued development of the commodity economy during the Tang Gaozong, Wuhou and Tang Xuanzong periods, Qian Qian’s monetary system gradually exposed its backward side. First of all, the shortcomings of 绢帛 as a currency, such as heavy weight, inconvenient division, difficult to transport and storage, etc., are not welcomed by the market. The function of 绢帛 as a currency tends to decline, and commodity trading tends to use a higher level of copper money as an intermediary. In order to increase the demand for copper coins in circulation, the Tang Dynasty’s official coins were unable to meet such requirements, which led to a growing shortage of copper in circulation, which in turn led to serious private casting and casting of copper coins, causing price fluctuations and currency. Unstable circulation and chaos in economic development pose a threat to the national fiscal system. The Tang government has continuously introduced laws and regulations to crack down on private casting and indiscriminate casting, and has banned the use of bad money. However, due to the severe shortage of copper supply, the value of the currency has risen steadily, and private casting and mining have been profitable, so the results are not satisfactory. ."

In the early stage of the taxation system, it was inherited from the Sui Dynasty. In 624, the average field system and the renting system were enacted. The average field system is the government granting land to the people and collecting their rents, which are divided into public and private fields. After he died, Gongtian paid the government for redistribution, and the remaining private land that could be passed on was \"Yongyetian\". Since the end of the Tang Dynasty, a large number of unowned land was produced, so there was sufficient land in the early Tang Dynasty. In addition to the people, government officials and the royal family also have their own Yongyetian. Compared with the Sui Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty sold a lot of land, but there are still strict restrictions. In terms of rent modulation, renting is a fixed-grant chestnut or rice every year. It is a labor service for the country every year. It is a ramie that is paid according to local special products. If ramie is not available, Silver two instead, the mediocre and the tune can also be used for a certain number of defamation. The spirit of this kind of system lies in the government's production of goods for the people. It pays taxes because of its production, that is, it does not re-enter the problem of the people, and it can prevent the merger. It is naturally a kind of good system. In the first half of the Tang Dynasty, the household tax increased year by year. Tang Gaozong had a household tax of more than 150,000 yuan, and by the time of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang Dynasty, it had reached more than two million."

If the politics are corrupted, the fields are over-mergered, the idle fields are too small, and the people are excessively avoiding taxes, these two systems will be disintegrated. The average annual field system of the Wu weekend began to be ineffective, and politics has gradually disappeared. In addition, the Turks and Khitan invaded successively, and the people fled the servitude, and the number of fugitives increased. In the late Tang Xuanzong Tianbao, non-taxable households accounted for about one-third of the country's total households; the unserved population accounted for about five-fifths of the national population, and tax evasion was widespread. After the Anshi rebellion, the number of escapists increased, and the regulation of rents could not be continued. Therefore, two tax laws appeared in the late Tang Dynasty. During the Tang Dezong period, Prime Minister Yang Yan formulated a two-tax law and abolished the rent tax for the remaining names. The two-tax law, that is, the government classifies the number of males and fields on the basis of the locality, and stipulates that the tax will be paid twice in summer and autumn. The merchant is taxed in the state where the goods are located, one-thirtieth of the total value of the goods. The tax amount was originally used as a unit, and was replaced by cloth when it came to Tang Muzong. In this way, bureaucrats, nobility, landlords and businessmen must pay taxes reasonably, alleviate the burden on civilians and increase the income of the government. Although the two tax laws simplify the taxation method, the land grant system was abolished. The household registration continued to fall into chaos, and the problem of field mergers was not resolved. Since then, China’s taxation system has followed the principle of the two-tax law and has not resumed the system of granting land."

With the rise in prices in the late Tang Dynasty, the exploitation of civilians by the two tax systems became more and more serious. In the late Tang Dynasty, in order to solve the situation of financial constraints, the company implemented a monopoly system for salt, iron, wine, and minerals, as well as tea taxes and customs duties. As a result, prices have soared, and public grievances have arisen. There are not many people who sell private salt. The salt iron monopoly system is also one of the direct reasons for the chaos of the Yellow Nest. The early Tang dynasty inherited the Confucianism of the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, such as the \"Five Classics of Justice\" edited by Kong Yingda. The thoughts of the Five Classics of Justice were mostly completed by the Han and Jin Dynasties, especially Zheng Xuan. The early Tang Dynasty was similar to the early Ming Dynasty. What the state is doing is the idea of implementing the pre-existing philosophy. After the middle of the Tang Dynasty, major ideological improvements occurred, and the ideas of Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Li Wei, Liu Yuxi and others were inherited. Moreover, the ideological values of Du Fu, Bai Juyi and others cannot be ignored. They are not just poets. The so-called classics of the later generations should be called \"Han and Jin Dynasties\" in the strict sense. The so-called science of the later generations should be called \"Tang and Song Dynasties\"."

Heaven is a natural vitality, and it is impossible to punish the world for its merits. Misfortunes, human encounters are purely self-created. Liu Yuxi's view of the development of Xunzi's heavenly view is that the universe is actually a matter. Heaven itself is also a matter. Although there are objective laws, it cannot affect personnel.

Liu Zhiji emphasized that historians should have their own innovative comments in the process of compiling history, which is the beginning of Chinese historical theory."

Although the political status of Buddhism is not as good as Taoism, its spread is wide, its economic strength is large, and the number of believers is far above the Taoism of the Tang Dynasty. Taoism follows the Laozi Li Er as the founder of the ancestors.

The Tang Dynasty was relatively tolerant of foreign religions. During the period, many foreign priests taught teaching methods, of which Islam and Nestorianism were the biggest. Islam is the state religion of Tang’s enemy food, called the “big food law”. In 651, the Prophet Muhammad's uncle, Shad, served as the envoy to China twice, and was granted permission by Gao Zong to receive and teach. He built the Huaisheng Temple in Guangzhou. In the next two centuries, Islam grew into China with the Silk Road and the Silk Road along the way. Nestorianism was introduced to China through the same route. Because it was mistakenly recognized as the state religion of Daqin State, it was called \"Da Qin Jingjiao\". In 638, it was recognized by the Tang Dynasty and received government funding to build the Daqin Temple in Chang'an and set up a stone monument. However, during the five years of Huichang, Tang Wuzong squandered the Buddha, so Nestorianism was also banned at the same time, and it has almost disappeared in China since then. Manichaeism was founded in 242 AD in the Persian State of Shapur I. After the Anshi Rebellion, the Manich religion returned to the country, and Manicheism taught in China under the shadow of the returning sect. The forces suffered a heavy blow, but they did not sever. The believers went to the south with weak political control and gradually combined with other religions. They established diplomatic missions in Fujian today and spread to the coastal areas of Southeast Zhejiang and Fujian.

That is, \"the old days are not enough, and the current arrogance is boundless.

The door shade is the younger generation to take on the predecessor's position. The outflow of the stream refers to the officials below the nine products passing the test and being promoted to the ranks of officials. At the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, the second way into the official is the mainstream. Later, Tang Taizong vigorously promoted the university, and the imperial examination system was gradually implemented. The popularization of education in the Tang Dynasty weakened the privilege of the traditional clan, strengthened effective administrative management, and expanded the social foundation of the political power; especially in the late Tang Dynasty, the Yellow Nest chaos hit a heavy blow to the gatekeepers. In the later Song Dynasty, the imperial examination system was truly Perfected. During the Tang Dynasty, many East Asian countries sent their aristocratic children to the Tang Dynasty and taught Confucian culture to foreign countries. Due to the absorption of Western features and religious colors, the Tang Dynasty art is very different from the dynasties. At the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, Yan Liben and Yan Lide brothers were good at painting characters. Wu Daozi has the title of \"painting holy\". He is also good at characters and landscapes, and absorbs the techniques of the Western Region School. The picture is rich in three-dimensional sense, and there is a saying that \"Wu belt is the wind.\" Zhang Wei and Zhou Wei are mainly painting pictures of maids. Their famous works include \"Knowledge Map\", \"Lady of the Motherland\" and \"Ladies' Map\" to further develop figure painting. During the Wei, Jin and Southern and Northern Dynasties, landscapes and landscapes were mostly for the theme of the characters. Since the Sui and Tang Dynasties, landscapes have become the theme, and there is an important branch of landscape painting. At that time, it was divided into two groups, the South and the North. The poet Wang Wei is good at ink paintings and landscape paintings. He is the representative of the Southern School. Su Shi commented that he has \"paints in the poems and poems in the paintings.\" The northern painter Li Sixun made good use of the green and green paintings. There are also Cao Ba, Han Ganshan painting horses, Han Yushan painting cows, Xue Yushan painting cranes, and side paintings to paint peacocks."

Tang Taizong Ping Gaochang got Gaochangle, and merged into the original nine music to become ten music: Yanle, Qingshangle, Xiliangle, Tianzhule, Gaoli, Kuzi, Anguole, Shulele, Kang Guole, Gao Changle. After Tang Gaozong, the ten music began to decline, the musicians began to study the new music and dance, and the differences between the various music gradually disappeared, and the Xuanzong Dynasty was abolished. Xuanzong himself is a musician. He likes to play a variety of musical instruments such as cymbals and gongs and drums. He is good at composing music. He has more than 100 pieces of music such as \"Ningshang Yufu\" and \"Small Breaking Music\". He attaches great importance to the career of Yale and will make ten music. It is divided into a sitting section and a legislature. It has been chosen by the seat of 300 people, and it is called \"Emperor Liyuan disciple\". Li Guinian and Yongjun are all famous singers. The Tang Dynasty dance is best known for its dance and soft dance. Jian Dance is named for its fast-paced, vigorous and bold, including \"Ao Liao\", \"Litchi\", \"Yu Lin\", \"Da Cangzhou\", \"Huang Wei\", \"A Lian\", \"Swords\", \"Hu Xuan\", \"Hu Teng\", \"Yang Liuzhi\" and so on. The soft dance is the literary dance, beautiful and soft, and the rhythm is soothing. There are \"The Hand Luo\", \"Echo Music\", \"Lan Ling Wang\", \"Spring\", \"Bet\", \"Wu Xia\", \"Liangzhou\" \"\", \"Green Waist\", \"Quizhizhi\", \"Ganzhou\" and so on. The famous dances \"Seven-Dance Dance\", \"Shangyuan Dance\" and \"Jiu Gong Dance\" are collectively called \"Three Dances\" and are popular in the court. Dancers include Yang Yuhuan, Gongsun Auntie, and Xie Aman. After the reign of Yongjia in the Jin Dynasty, the Western Region dance music was passed down to the Central Plains. It was merged with Huaxia Dance for more than two centuries. It has been a strong Hu Feng feature in the Tang Dynasty. A variety of soft dance dances use a kind of high-spirited look, and their feet are turned into a whirlwind movement. Because of the source of the Western Region, it is called \"Hu Xuan\". In the Tang Dynasty, the music was mostly acrobatics, collectively referred to as \"Hundred Plays\", including items such as smashing, collision, jumping pills, spitting fire, swallowing knives, somersaults, and kicking carpets."

In the Tang Dynasty society, although the power of the clan was cut, it is still not an equal society. In the \"Tang Law\", it is also clearly stated that people are divided into two categories: \"good\" and \"sui\".

The so-called \"Hu Feng\" refers specifically to the various social classes in the Tang Dynasty that are not the original social customs of the Han nationality. Among them, there are mainly customs from the northern nomads and the Western Regions, and there are also Wuhu Xie. The social customs and customs left by the nomadic peoples in the south of the country, the result of the combined effects of various factors, formed the situation of the prevailing Hu Feng in the Tang Dynasty. Such as \"Hu Le\", \"Hu Fu\" and \"Hu Shi\" are extremely popular in Chang'an City. The foreign costume culture of the Western Region has a great influence on the costumes of the Tang Dynasty. In the northern part of the Sui and Tang Dynasties, there was a Hu-Hun dual-track system. The daily Yongfu clothing was Xianbei Hufu, and the solemn sacrifices were changed to traditional Chinese clothes. The status of women in the Tang Dynasty is relatively high and is reflected in costumes. The aristocratic and court women are mostly loose skirts with a half-naked chest. The skirt is tied higher, between the waist. The singing women's costumes are dazzling and beautiful, and the nobles are dyed rich and elegant. According to the collar style, it is divided into round neck, lapel, square collar, oblique collar, straight collar and chicken heart collar. Emperor Wendi created a ceremony to wear Huanglongpao. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang Gaozu, the subjects were not allowed to wear yellow, and the yellow robe became a special service for the royal family."

          "trans_context": "In folklore, mythology refers to the sacred story about humanity and the changing world. In a broad sense, \"myth\" can refer to any ancient legend, expressing the ideology of the nation through the form of a story. The myth comes from the primitive society, and humans explain natural phenomena through reasoning and imagination. However, because the level of knowledge at this time is very low, it is often shrouded in a mysterious color. Myth is the expression of people trying to conquer nature with the help of fantasy. The image of God in mythology mostly has the power of Superman, and is the idealization of the understanding and desire of primitive human beings. The history of the primitive society of many nations begins with a mythological story. Most of the characters in mythology come from the image of primitive human beings. Most of the mythical characters created by the more developed tribes are related to hunting; the mythical characters created by the well-developed tribes are mostly related to agriculture. The heroes in mythology also use swords, axes and arrows as weapons. From mythology, you can see some of the ancestors' deeds. Whether it is the primitive social nation in the earliest regions of world civilization, or the nation still in the primitive society in the world today, many of the myths and stories they have spread are similar. Mythology is also the precedent of literature, and it is the earliest fantasy oral prose work of mankind. For example, \"Zhuangzi Yingdi Wang\" said: \"Thai's, it's lying, it feels like, one is a horse, one is a cow.\" Myths have certain regional and regional, different civilizations or The nation has its own meaning of understanding."

          "trans_context": "In academics, the myth that scholars say must have several conditions: a single event or story that describes the primitive age of mankind or the early stages of human evolution. The believers must believe in these events and stories. The story that the inheritor himself knows is a fictional story is called \"fables.\" It must be that the people of the ancient ethnic group collectively created and passed down. If it is personal creation, and there is no participation through the inheritance and the members of the masses, the story is no longer myth. The concepts similar to myths are legends and folktales. These three words refer to different types of traditional stories. Unlike mythology, folk tales can occur in any age, anywhere; people who inherit folk tales do not regard them as true and sacred. Legends are generally regarded as true, but legends generally occur in more recent episodes, and the legendary world is almost the same as the present world. The protagonist of the legend is generally human, and the protagonist of the myth is generally a supernatural character. The three concepts of defining myths, legends and folktales are just to classify traditional stories. In many cultures, there is not necessarily a clear line between myths and legends. In some cultures, only traditional stories are divided into two categories: folk tales and myths and legends. Even myths and folktales cannot be completely distinguished. A nation believes that it is a fictional story that may be regarded as a historical fact by another nation. In fact, when a myth loses its religious status, it is more like a folktale. For example, the giants, fairies, and human heroes of Europe used to be divine. They were all used as folktales after the spread of Christianity."

According to this theory, the ancient storytellers repeatedly recited a period of history, and the characters in the story were deified. For example, some scholars believe that the myth of Fengshen and Russia comes from an ancient real king who taught the people to use sailboats and master the techniques of using the wind, which was later circulated into Fengshen. Zeus was a wise king who was buried in Crete after his death. The ancient Greek writers Herodotus and Prodix in the 5th century BC supported this claim. The Greek mythologist Jewish Myros is the most famous person in a theory. Such thoughts are also called \"Jewish Myrosism.\" Still others believe that myths come from the apartment. For example, the ancient Greek gods are regarded as the interpretation and metaphor of natural phenomena. Apollo represents the sun and Poseidon represents water. A similar theory holds that mythology is the carrier of philosophical or spiritual concepts: Athena stands for wisdom and justice, and Aphrodite stands for desire. The 19th-century Sanskrit scholar Max Muller supported the mythology of the mythology. He believed that mythology was originally a metaphorical description of nature, and it was gradually understood by literals. For example, people often use rhetoric to describe the sea as \"inciting and restless\", and later the mythical sea god is described as violent and irritable."

For example, the ancients worshiped the natural forces such as fire and air, and gradually imagined them as gods. This theory is called \"the god of thinking.\" According to this theory, the ancients often regard things without life as people with subjective consciousness. So they describe natural events as human beings, which often have human character. These stories are combined to form a myth. According to the myth-ritual theory, all existing myths are inseparable from rituals. The most extreme statement is that all myths are the interpretation of rituals by early humans. This theory was first proposed by the Bible scholar William Smith. According to Smith's theory, the initial rituals and myths have nothing to do with. Later, we forgot the reason for the original ceremony, and tried to compile some stories to explain the ceremony, and claimed that the ceremony was held to commemorate the events described in the myth. The anthropologist James Fraser also holds a similar theory. He believed that the primitive people first believed in magic. Later, when people lost confidence in magic, they invented myths and said that the magical rituals they held before were used to appease the gods."

          "trans_context": "Some religious historians believe that one of the most important functions of mythology is to establish patterns of behavior and provide religious experiences. By retelling the myths, members of the traditional society temporarily separate themselves from the current world, returning the mind to the mythological era, thus bringing itself closer to the sacred world. In some cases, society will try to reproduce the mythological scenes when retelling myths. For example, people will reproduce the healing methods God used in the creation of the world, hoping to cure the sick people. Roland Barthes also agrees with this view. He believes that modern culture is doing similar things. Because science cannot define human morality, people still use religious experiences to connect with a more ancient era. Those ancient times have higher moral standards in people's minds, which are completely different from the current technological era. The religious scholar Joseph Campbell defines four basic functions: mysterious function, scientific function, sociological function, and educational function. Comparative mythology refers to the comparison of different myths to find out their common themes and characteristics, or the myths of branching with the system, such as Mongolian mythology and Turkic mythology. The origin of both is Ergununa, probably because It is produced by the nomads who exchanged or separated from each other."

In 1609 he published two laws on planetary motion in his journal New Astronomy, and in 1618 discovered the third law. Kepler was fortunate to have a very accurate astronomical data observed and collected by the famous Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. Around 1605, according to Brah's planetary position data, Kepler discovered that the movement of the planet obeyed three fairly simple laws. At the end of the same year, he wrote and completed the publication. However, it was not until 1609 that it was published in the Science Journal of New Astronomy. This is because Brah's observations belong to his heirs and cannot be used by others. As a result, some legal disputes have caused delays. In astronomy and physics, Kepler's law gave Aristotle and Ptolemy a great challenge. He advocates that the earth is constantly moving; the orbits of the planets are not circular, but elliptical; the speed of the revolution of the planets is not constant. These arguments have greatly shaken the astronomy and physics of the time. After nearly a century of research on the moon, the sleepless night, physicists can finally use physics to explain the mysteries. Isaac Newton applied his second law and the law of universal gravitation to rigorously prove Kepler's law in mathematics, and also let people understand the physical meaning."

Kepler's second law, also known as the law of equal area: in the same time, the area swept by the sun and the moving planet is equal. This law actually reveals the conservation of angular momentum of the orbit around the sun. Kepler's third law, also known as the law of cycles, is that the squares of the orbits of the planets are proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of their elliptical orbits. It is not difficult to derive from this law: the gravity between the planet and the sun is inversely proportional to the square of the radius. This is an important basis for Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation."

In addition, Newton's law can also calculate solutions to other aspects, the orbit of the planet can be parabolic or hyperbolic. This is the result that Kepler's law cannot predict. In the case where one particle is not too lighter than the other, according to the solution of the generalized two-body problem, each particle moves around their common centroid. This is also unpredictable by Kepler's law. Kepler's Law uses geometric language to link the coordinates and time of the planet to the orbital parameters. Newton's second law is a differential equation. The derivation of Kepler's law involves some techniques for analyzing differential equations. Before deriving Kepler's first law, Kepler's second law must be derived, because Kepler's first law requires some calculations from Kepler's second law."

          "trans_context": "Oxford is a public research academy of federal universities in Oxford, England. It is the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the second-largest institution of higher education in the world. Although the actual date of creation of the university is still unclear, the recorded teaching history dates back to 1096. The number of teachers and students in Oxford has risen rapidly since Henry II banned British students from going to the University of Paris in 1167. In 1209, the conflict between Oxford teachers and students and the townspeople made some Oxford scholars take a different approach. They moved to the northeastern Cambridge town and established the later Cambridge University. These two old universities are very similar in all aspects of the school-running model. The two universities have a long history of competition and are often referred to as \"Niuqiao.\" The University of Oxford consists of 38 independent colleges and 4 academic colleges. Each college is an independent administrative agency and is affiliated with the university. They have their own management structure, admissions and student activities; the academic college is responsible for arranging lectures and guiding research projects, as well as preparing courses and giving academic guidance. Oxford does not have its own main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate education at the university includes weekly tutoring courses at the colleges and courses offered by academic colleges. In addition to these colleges and private schools, the venues include lecture halls, classrooms and laboratories provided by the school. The University of Oxford also hosts two prestigious scholarship programs: the Clarendon Scholarship, established in 2001; and the Rhodes Scholarship, which has attracted many outstanding graduate students over the past century. Oxford also has the world's largest university press and the largest university library system in the UK. The University of Oxford has trained a number of social celebrities, including 26 British Prime Ministers, 27 Nobel Laureates, four Turing Award winners and multinational leaders and political figures."

Special attention is given to students enrolled in medical, dental and veterinary courses at Oxford, Cambridge and other universities who are required to complete the system registration process by October 15 of each year. In addition, in order to have a better personalized judgment, students can not apply to Oxford and Cambridge at the same time. Most students choose to apply to one of the colleges, and the colleges will also communicate with each other to ensure that eligible students can find the college that suits them best, and will not be admitted because of a preference for a college. Priorities include expected public exam results, various letters of recommendation, and immediate entrance exams and interview results. About 60% of applicants are eligible for priority each year. If too many priority applicants prefer the same institution, these students will be reassigned to the under-enrolled colleges. The relevant colleges will also arrange interviews for these students. During the interview, the invited students will receive 3 days. Free room and board. A student can get interviews from multiple colleges. Students living outside of Europe can conduct an interview assessment via the Internet. Admission notices are usually sent by the College on Christmas Eve. About a quarter of the students admitted each year enter a college that they have not applied for. Some university courses use open admissions, allowing students who have not previously enrolled in any of the colleges to be re-examined after the August Advanced Level Examination is released."

Famous publications include the Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford Concise English Dictionary, Oxford World Classic, Oxford National Biography Dictionary, and the National Dictionary of Concise Dictionary. Oxford ranks among the top 10 in the world in all types of colleges and universities, and often competes with Cambridge University for the reputation of “Best in the UK”. Among them, Oxford has been ranked 11th in the \"Best University Guide in the UK\" published by The Sunday Times. The World Reputation Ranking of Times Higher Education has also ranked it as \"the six most famous universities in the world\" for five consecutive years. In Oxford, academic dresses are required whenever you take the test, accept entrance tests, conduct disciplinary hearings, and meet with university officials. A referendum with 4,382 participants in 2008 showed that 81% of Oxford students objected to changing the mandatory rules for wearing test dresses to voluntary. However, the students said that the subject of this vote seems to be \"whether the tradition of wearing a dress should be abandoned by default\" rather than \"whether it should be changed to a voluntary nature\" because this survey assumes that if a small number of people choose not to Wearing, others will follow. In July 2012, the school improved the rules on dresses and made it more accessible to transgender people. In addition, different colleges have their own traditions and etiquette. For example, some colleges regularly hold dinners."

The historian Wells Girard taught the scholars in 1188, and the first foreign scholar arrived in Oxford in 1190. Since 1201, the University has appointed the \"Principal\" as its leader. The leadership team has been elected as an inspector since 1231. The school was also awarded the Royal Charter by King Henry III in 1248 to establish its status as a university. In 1209, the townspeople of Oxford clashed with the teachers and students of the school. A group of university scholars moved to Cambridge Town in the northeast to establish a scholar association in order to take refuge, and later developed into Cambridge University.

In addition, many monastics begin to have influence and provide students with dorms and schools. At about the same time, many donors have set up different independent academies as self-sufficient academic groups. The earliest founders of the Academy included William Durham, who donated to the University College in 1249, and John I. De Belleol, founder of the Lior College. Justice Walter Demerton, who was also one of the founders of the Academy, also set rules for the College, and the Merton College became a model for Oxford and later Cambridge College. After that, the students became more and more fond of the life of the college and abandoned the accommodation of the monastic society and the school."

Resident scholars of this period included William Grosing, who contributed greatly to the Greek revival, and the famous biblical theologian John Colle.

In 1872, the latter was split into the School of Jurisprudence and Modern History, and the seminary was subsequently founded. In addition to these Bachelor of Arts (Honours) courses, the school has also offered a Bachelor of Civil Law. In the 19th century, the university implemented several administrative reforms. This includes a shift in the mode of entrance examinations by writing instead of oral, a relaxation of the conditions for admission to non-Christians, and the establishment of four women's colleges. The decision of the Privy Council in the 20th century gradually separated the university from the traditional style. Although the school has traditionally attached great importance to classical knowledge, it has also included science and medicine in one of the university education since the 19th century. Before 1920, the understanding of ancient Greek was one of the necessary conditions for Oxford admission; before 1960, the recognition of Latin was also the most basic requirement for admission. From the middle to the middle of the 20th century, many scholars from the European continent were replaced by Nazism and communist advocates, and they came to Oxford to continue their careers. To date, Oxford has trained a number of British political figures and leaders, and more than 50 heads of state are also Oxford alumni."

          "trans_context": "Oxford first established a female undergraduate examination system in 1875, and the first four female academies were established under the influence of the Women's Higher Education Promotion Alliance. The Margaret School was founded in 1878, and the Somerville College was founded in the following year. The first students of the two women's colleges began as lectures at the loft of a bakery in Oxford. The other three women's colleges: St. Joseph's College, St. Hill's College and St. Anne's College also became members of the College of the College in 1886, 1893 and 1952, respectively. At the beginning of the 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were once considered to be full of \"male privilege\" until October 1920, when women were eligible to become university members and enroll in a full undergraduate course. However, by 1927, university leaders had set a limit on the number of students enrolled. The number of female students in Oxford was limited to one-fourth of that of men. Until 1957, this policy was abolished. Before the 1970s, the students enrolled in Oxford's colleges were single-sex, which limited the female enrollment rate because the number and capacity of female colleges were small. In 1974, Brezinos, Jesus, Wadhan, Hertford and St. Catherine became the first former male colleges to accept women's registration. In 1988, the proportion of undergraduate female students reached 40%. In 2008, the last female academy, St. Hill's College, also admitted to male students. This means that all Oxford academies become educational institutions for men and women. In 2013, the ratio of total acceptance rates for male and female students was close to 18.1:19.0."

The snowfall in the coastal plains such as Tokyo and Mito is mostly in the form of wet snow and powder snow. The low pressure on the South Bank is wet snow, and the winter is mostly powder snow. The snowy areas in winter are mostly in the northern mountainous areas near Nasu and the Three Kingdoms Mountains. The exception is the cold and low temperature snowfall, which will cause local frontal snowfall in the area between the Fannie Peninsula and Sagami Bay. According to the Keben climate classification method, most of the temperate high-lying mountains belong to the sub-cold climate, and the volcanic island, the southern bird island and the Chongzhidao island have a tropical climate. In the plains of winter, especially when the cold current strikes, there are surrounding mountains in the south Guandong and coastal areas to block the cold current, which is not easily affected by the cold current from the mainland. The temperature is often higher than that of the southern part of Kyushu and the seed island. Even under the influence of the cold current, the sunny South Kanto has a relatively high temperature during the day, and the Kanto Plain is more likely to feel the cold when the low pressure on the south bank causes snow."

The record of human activities in the Kanto region dates back to the Paleolithic era. In the Kanto loam in the remains of the rock formations in Gunma Prefecture, the Paleolithic stone tools were excavated, but because the Kanto loam soil was acidic soil, human bones could not be excavated. The Kanto region in the Jomon period benefited from the warm environment, and the Jomon people formed large colonies throughout the Kanto region. In the current environment, East Japan was more suitable for fishing collection than Western Japan. It is speculated that South Kanto in the Jomon period was the region with the highest population density in the Japanese archipelago. In the Jomon period, the central and southern lowlands of Ibaraki Prefecture and Chiba Prefecture are still in the ocean except for the northern part of the total platform, the eastern part of Tokyo, and the southeast of Saitama. This shallow inland sea is a good fishing ground, and now the area far from the coast has also found huge shellfish such as the Galleria. In the Yayoi era, Kanto began to have rice fields in the paddy field. At that time, farming activities were carried out centering on the Tama River basin and the Sagami Plain. As the sea receded and the sand piled up, the vast alluvial plains formed in the lower reaches of the Ligon River flowing into the Tokyo Bay were limited to immature irrigation techniques and could not be cultivated. The platform covered by the soil layer in the Kanto region is still a forest due to lack of water."

          "trans_context": "The theoretical basis of passive investment is the stochastic strolling theory based on the efficient market hypothesis. Compared with value investing or trend investing, it shows “to benefit from the continuous development of the market”. The main form of expression is the investment index fund. Value investment is an investment method that seeks to analyze the intrinsic value of a company from the fundamentals of macroeconomics, industry and specific enterprises. Among them, because of different propensities, they can be divided into value investment and growth investment: value investment: more inclined to focus on the safety margin of investment, often investing in low P/E ratio and low P/B ratio. Growth investment: More inclined to focus on the profit growth and sustainability of the target company, often investing in stocks with high price-earnings ratio and high price-to-book ratio. Both of these investment methods are based on the asset valuation of the company. Compared with the current enterprise value, the low stock price and good profit growth are all part of the investment value of the enterprise. The growth can pass the future of the enterprise. The free cash flow is discounted to materialize. Because it is very difficult to accurately determine the specific growth of a company, when investing, it is necessary for growth investors to reduce investment risks with a certain margin of safety; value investors must also take into account the future development trend of the enterprise, otherwise the value of the enterprise may be As time goes by, it gradually shrinks and makes investment losses. After all, the value investment by means of liquidation of target companies is rare, so the two are not contradictory. Famous value investors include Peter Lynch, Warren Buffett and more."
